"Wedding speech in a few days, social anxiety So I’ve always had an aspect of social anxiety within me, usually in groups of more than 3 or 4 people. One on one or in a group of 3 in absolutely fine.

I had some bad experiences of speeches and presentations back in high school and totally avoided it throughout my adult life.

I’m now 31 and the only public speaking (if you can calll it that) I’ve done is a hand full of interviews to no more than 3 people. 

I’m my brothers best man at his wedding in a few days and I’ve got to do it in front of 100 or so people which seems absolutely alien to me. My heart races and I get sweaty palms just thinking about it or practicing in front of a mirror. 

I hate the sound of my own voice and it just begins to break/shake and I go bright red and my mouth makes this involuntary frowning thing like I’m about to cry whenever I’ve had to do it in the past. 

I’ve read online countless tips and advice but I just don’t feel these people have it half as bad as I do? I’ve resorted to getting a low dose of diazepam from my doctor (only 6 2mg tablets) and they have told me to take a maximum of 3 of theses before the speech. Will this honestly help? I appreciate the concerns about mixing alcohol and diazepam but I do believe that is a low dose and I only plan on having 1 or 2 small bottles of beer before the speech.

Any tips/advice?

But the symptoms described in the title above were a little... odd. Epilepsy-concerns emerge, perhaps mild, but still leaving me concerned. Could it just be something that had to do with my eyes needing to adjust, or the settings not being correct and thus messing me up for a bit, or should I be worried about epilepsy/photosensitivity?

"Hypomania and Hypersexuality Bit of a controversial confession so ask me anything... 

Im female in my 30's, married, with children.
Home and business owner.
I have been with my husband a good decade long and have been married a couple of years.

I struggle with bipolar affective disorder type 2 with ultra rapid cycling.
I get depressive low periods. I also get hypomanic, and when I do, I get extreme hypersexual symptoms that I act on, as I haven't found a means to curb the extreme intensity of it yet.

I've had a few extra curricular affairs.
But I have also been having an affair with my ex boyfriend that has lasted years.
Due to my condition I am a bit of a flake. 
When I'm hypomanic I feel like can't breathe without him, the inner most part of my soul
Craves him. But when I'm depressive I don't want a bar of him.

My husband has no idea about who I really am or what I'm really like.

"Anxiety has ruined me Just a vent tbh .

I've suffered from anxiety my whole life and as I grow older, I feel my anxiety getting progressively worse instead of better. Ironically even therapy scares me as I'm not really one to ""open up"" in front of others in fear of burdening/boring them. Sounds silly but I almost feel embarrassed paying someone to help me who otherwise wouldnt give me a second thought

On the topic of skills, I wholeheartedly believe I have 0 skills. I've always been told I'm smart but no one sees how much time and struggle goes behind good grades. When I'm honest about not being intelligent, understandably people think I'm fishing for compliments.  Even then I think I just got lucky with good questions and random guesses. Literally no achievement I think I really deserved and was more abt the odds being in my favour. Its all due to subliminals and manifestation rather than talent

As well, my social skills are horrendous. I'm so awkward w people and can barely keep a convo going with those close to me. I rely on them to start and keep convos going cause I'm just so boring and unfunny. I have an extremely hard time communicating with males too. Idk I completely stiffen up and come across so awkward. I like art but again I'm not talented at it despite so much practice and was rejected from an art school unsurprisingly. I'm learning to drive and after 3 lessons I still can't move a car without sweating buckets, shaking and struggling to control it, even moving off is so challenging.  I'm expecting to waste a ton of money due to my incompetence at understanding basic instructions and crippling fear. I'm bad at sports, games , mediocre at cooking and just about everything I've tried. Heck I can't even ride a bike

I couldn't list a single talent I have. Anything I'm half decent at is a result of 5x the effort generally needed. For example I'm currently writing an essay thats taken me all day to understand and plan when it was only meant to be an hour task. There just doesn't seem to be anything 'redeemable' for me

My anxiety has made me become more and more closed off from people. I will sit in toilets at school in fear of being looked at. I never contribute to class in fear of being wrong. I sit on the bus with my hood on so I'm not looked at. Even when I briefly had a job, I couldn't work out the basics that everyone learnt in a day. It was very telling that this incompetence wasn't only reflecting in school but other places. Sweating is one of the main symptoms I experience and its created deep rooted insecurities for me

I can stay somewhat in peace at home but I do have struggles here and there. But obviously its not practical to rely on home for peace as I fear I will completely isolate myself this way

"Can't even show up for my own life and do the activities I wanna do. Honestly don't know where to go from here. Existence is completely wasted on me. I have group-oriented activities I want to join, yet I just can't do it...I can't even risk social rejection or ridicule.  

I'm currently in Thailand on a six-week trip with my partner and child. While that sentence doesn't exactly sound like it puts me in the category of avoidant personality disorder, I am one of the most avoidant people on Earth. 

I spent three years at university and only ever talked to about four people, none of whom I developed friendships with. I've spent my entire adult life working remotely alone at home so that I can avoid any work environment that requires socializing. Even my relationship is pretty low-quality; we don't exactly sit down and have lengthy interesting conversations every day.

But perhaps even worse still, there are various group-oriented activities I'd love to try that would bring value to my life, and I can't at all bring myself to do them. One example is muay Thai. I signed up for a class yesterday, arrived at the gym, and turned back at the entrance. This has happened several times. And it's a consistent theme in my adult life, whether the activity is a martial art, soccer, or a hiking meetup. 

Basically, I can't show up for my own life and do the activities that I value. I'm not really living and never really have. I'm now 32 years old FFS, close to middle-aged. I'm almost certain I'll be dead before 35...what a waste of a human I am.",Personality disorder
"actual problems mixed with anxiety I have one legitimate issue that i will get an appointment for on monday (sadly, the weekend is inbetween).  
My BPM, which usually is around 55-65, got higher and flip flops around a lot (it is between 80 and 100 now when i am sitting or lying down) and my bloodpressure similarly got a tad higher (not to worrying heights, it is below 140) and, what is worrying me, flip flops around a lot when i take several measurements (like going from 100 to 130 and back several times when i do not move and measure 10 times over the course of some minutes, even when i am sitting still and relaxed).

This is an issue i legitimately think might have to do with my thyroids (no cancer fears about the thyroids, i think it might just be hyperactive and that makes sense because i am celiac and celiacs often have other autoimmune diseases, most commonly thyroid stuff).

Now to what actually makes me scared and is probably nothing:

Today, after a long time of it not happening (happened a lot before my celiac diagnosis), my whole body vibrated with my pulse (i could feel it everywhere, most importantly neck), my pulse was actually off (too high, above 100 even when sitting, sometimes going as far as near 120) and i felt pressure in my gutts and chest. The pressure was so bad that, depending on how i moved, it felt like organs press on organs and i felt sick.

My neck was not only vibrating with my pulse, it also got very tensed (not some kind of stiffness that made it unable to move, but i felt like someone grabbed me just at the start of the back of my head and pressed his finger into it, shutting down the blood flow except for the very strong pulsations).

I had these symptoms before (more or less) as i said, and I assume that it is Roemheld syndrome (a benign, but very scary kind of thing) because i know that my heart is fine. It got very thoroughly checked back then and it was fine in the months before, i could do sports, i am not feeling weak, i am not having syncopes).

Roemheld syndrome means that you got so much pressure in your gutts due to air and food that it presses against your heart, chest and lungs so you experience very scary sensations, similar to angina pectoris, but it is not actually dangerous. Your heart rate is increased, your chest feels tight, you might have shortness of breath, but you are going to be fine once the pressure is gone. But that can take a long time and in that time you think you will die and you need to go to the ER.

I had that today, the first time in almost a year and i was kinda broken that it came back. I thought i beat it, and then suddenly here i am, thinking i got a lung emboli, or my veins are shut down, or there is a tumor pressing on my heart or veins. Or i got a brain aneurysm because i also felt pulsations in my head and heard noises in my air (i dont think these are noises it usually makes when you got very high bp, since my bp is not actually that high and it was only one air AND i got a head MRT the year before and it was fine).  


Now, i am very sure that roemheld is what caused this, because yesterday i drank a lot of booze and cola while eating and i had a bit of pressure before that to begin with, but the reason that i am still like 'ya, gonna die' is that i lost so much weight compared to last time.  
I lost more than 10 kilo so there should be far more space for my innards. I am not overweight anymore.

So, what my anxiety brain thinks is this: Back then, a tumor right behind my sternum, pressing on my heart. Ofc the pressure got better when i lost weight and stuff, but now it grew enough to make up for it and it presses again against my heart and no doctor will check for that (obviously the tumor is not visible via sono but NEEDS MRT or CT) and at some point it will just destroy my heart and I will die. Or my neck or bones presses on important veins and i will also die because the vein will burst (even tho i had an mrt of the neck (for legit reasons) just 2 months ago and while my neck had issues, noone said anything about veins).

&amp;#x200B;

I am fine now because i drank a lot of herbal tea that helps with roemheld, but i am still here thinking about tumors and also thyroid cancer.

As a bonus point, i think about it even being my own fault because i might have ingested gluten accidently (i probably didnt, but i live, for some time, with a non celiac so there is some chance there was contamination of my food, but he is careful and i am too, so it aint probable) and the gluten made the belly angry.

I really hope this was a one time thing and i am not falling back into anxiety due to roemheld, i will be extra careful about food in the next days.  


I will not eat today until the belly died down (and sadly my eating choice are limited due to celiac in any case, not a lot of good 'get healthy' food, at least not in my flat) and drink very much of the herbal tea.

&amp;#x200B;

When i feel better, i will do some sit ups and push ops to try to straighten out my belly and i will massage my neck as much as i can.

So far i am at least not predialing the medics anymore.

"Feeling guilt. I've had the perfect childhood, all the opportunities, great parents, a lot of friends (that even now, 30 years later are my friends). 

My parents supported me in everything, my mom is the best.

Then I got meningitis and everything changed. I was never the same again. Started doing drugs to cope with my emotions (yes, weed is still an addictive drug) , partying all weekends with my friends. Xtc was just a normal thing when going to techno parties. It's the love drug... You feel so connected with others on xtc. Everyone was on xtc. 
Got addicted to weed for 20 years. Luckily I quitted with that 3 years ago.

My mom was always worried about me. Now she's 73 years old and still worrying about me. 
It's my task now taking care of them. But I can't. 
My dad is dementing. When visiting them I use kratom(legal). 
I feel normal and happy then. 
Me happy=my mom happy. But it's masking. Not the real me. If my mom sees me happy and positive... And yes... I notice that directly...if my parents are happy and not worrying... I feel better, I don't want them to worry. 
I just want her to be proud, she says it doesn't matter. I am who I am and she will always be proud of me. But... I see the difference, i can read and feel emotions from others very good.... More a curse than a blessing. 

Sometimes I can't clean my  house cause I feel to bad. And really.. It feels that people care more about that instead of me. The first thing they ask...did you clean. They don't ask... How do you feel.

So, if someone wants to visit me now I need to know it a few days before the visit. Then I clean, even if I feel bad. My mom can't visit me unexpected.

She wants to help me... I don't want that anymore. I'm not a kid. 
Masking my emotions with kratom for seeing people and not worrying them.. Yes, I'm not complaining about my life when I see them, I'm positive. And I really feel good than. So.. It's not fake... But In a way it's fake. 
It's making things worse. 
Not for the outside world, they see me when I'm on kratom and don't understand why I'm on healthcare. Sometimes I hear that others are saying I'm taking advantage of the healthcare system. That's very hurtfull to hear.
I realize I could have normal life. Just one dose of kratom.. And I feel normal. Like I want to be. 
But that's not how it works. 
Now, if someone wants to visit me I use kratom for having less anxiety. And yes, kratom is a miracle for anxiety, depression. A very difficult choice.. Staying at home for weeks or using kratom, going to a concert and seeing new people. 
On my YT channel I'm the most positive person. Making videos, talking, social. No one has a clue about how I really feel. 

My biggest fear is losing my parents.. And it's coming closer and closer. I feel so much guilt towards them. I can't even think about that. I owe everything to them. I want them when they leave this earth... I want them to know that I'm doing good. That it's not their fault. They don't need to worry. I will be alright. So they can go in peace. 

Gonna stop now cause I'm tearing up.

"Job interview tomorrow Been un/under-employed for a couple months now, after an incredibly high-stress and high-reward contract ended (side note: it was an entire year, and I managed to do it without taking a mental health day the entire time!). It opened a lot of doors for me, including for the job that I'm interviewing for in the morning... 

But it's not a job that I necessarily *want*. It'll look good at a resume and will get me a step further in the direction I want to go, but I'm worried it'll come around and bite me in the ass later, too. I'm worried my mental health will flare up, and shit'll go sideways (like it usually does) and I'll end up burning everything down and making it a flaming road block instead of a bridge to where I want to be.

I wonder what this says about me. The only thing that comes to mind when facing this fact is ""Am I that reprehensible?"". And I know that sounds like I am expecting things of people but isn't a friendship supposed to be a 2-way street? 

I feel so crushingly lonely when I think about all this. There's this video from Kurzgesagt about loneliness and in that they say that the feeling of loneliness has the evolutionary purpose of saving you from the threat of being excluded from the tribe. If these were the days when humans lived in tribes I would basically be deemed to not be worthy of survival.

Every friendship that starts has so much at stake for me. I can't face another one-sided thing. It's such a slap in the face, like I'm not worth knowing. Which is why I avoid investing myself in anything nowadays.

These strings of continuous unreciprocated experiences have left me incapable of taking care of myself. Everything I do for myself feels not worth doing. Even talking about myself feels like a waste of time. If I try so hard to be part of the world and it rejects me, why should I care to survive at all?",Personality disorder
"Did not even want to say hi to me I have an online friend and they really wanted me to meet their friend. I was hesitant but they told me that they’re nice so I joined their little discord server (literally had like 5 people total with me) with the intentions of maybe sending a message or two and never again. But their friend didn’t even want to say hi to me. Like my friend told him to say hi and he literally just said “no” . This happened a few days ago and I’m like really upset about it. He barely even knows anything about me.

I talked to my friend today and they said that they think he is just jealous that i’m sort of close with them. But I’m still really really hurt and upset about. I feel like I’m not even deserving of being acknowledged or spoken to.",Personality disorder
"This year I should have been focusing on my thesis. I even got a scholarship for it so I can work on it full-time, before I did it part-time. Before I was very career-oriented + had a lot of gimmicks. But tbh, I felt like I was already at a decline mentally during the past years due to other external events + anxiety. Tbh due to just a string of unfortunate circumstances my grad school academic life was not going the way I hoped.The wrong thing I did is that I got that scholarship during a very bad time in my life. I thought that focusing on one thing would be enough. Basically I could not even remember what I was doing for the past months. I still feel like I am in a groundhog day of sorts tbh. For whatever reason, I cannot wake up when I want to, I cannot sleep, I just get anxiety all the time when I am awake.And the worst of it all is that I cannot get myself to do work or even think about the technicalities of things related to my thesis. Such that I cram things when reporting to my adviser.I have literally developed an anxiety or fear of doing my own work which I actually love.And now I have wasted months which I should have used for developing my thesis proposal.I still have time I suppose. I feel like I could draft one up in a month. Especially since I am in it full-time right now.But fuck it. it is only been this week that I even got a little bit of work done again that is not just due to anxiety-induced clarity of mind that I am forced to cram.So far I am nearing a month of trying to exercise everyday, and eating healthy. It took me this long to finally get my shit together for that.I have been trying to CBT myself for months. And so I have gotten out of that depressive hole at least.This week I am trying to do work little by little. Trying to keep to a schedule. So far I feel like it is working.But fudge how the fuck do I deal with this whole fuck up I did. I do not have papers with my adviser -- I did with previous research projects that are work-related. But really just due to those work project I was full-time in being not handled well by faculty, the papers were not what I hoped them to be.And now I am cramming for a thesis hopefully by the end of December. Worst case, well I am finishing up my thesis late. But dammit I want to publish papers too. I do not want to waste this time/opportunity since if I do not do well with this, I cannot even count a PhD as part of my future. I should have just taken a leave goddamit. it is understandable this pandemic --- is still very shitty at my country. But I went and got a scholarship that ties me in the whole thing.I cannot even get recommendation letters from my previous work projects because I left them due to their issues --- it was outrageous. It really is, friends told me I got an unlucky streak and they agree that they really were shit. Well there is 1 that went well. But that is just 1! So all I am hoping is to get a recommendation letter in the future from my current adviser. And here I am messing up things.I feel like I still can do something about this. Because moving forward and all that.And I feel like my adviser has a feel for how some of us advisees of theirs are not doing well mentally. Because we do not follow up with him. And we just basically disappeared at times. And he does not call us out on it so far. He just accepts and deals with whatever we report when we talk to him.Honestly I felt like he should have kicked me out months ago.But the thing is, despite all things. I have smiling depression. And have been in and out of this for years. My therapist tells me I should get tested for ADHD, but honestly right now in my country it is a bit difficult to get diagnosed for it. She told me meds may help me.The issue with this is, people around me likely think that all is ok. They think I am upbeat. So in all effect I look like a slob or have no concept of time or really just threw away my thesis.But the thing is I actually really tried to get to it everyday. Honestly I still have to do some work from another thing and I am putting that off as well. Trying to wake up everyday and sitting in front of my computer.Doing nothing but my mind is on the thing. And time flies by.And shit.So yeah this long rant. I just do not see how I can get over this whole thing even if I get over my work anxiety. Is it all for naught? :(((**TLDR: I feel like I should just move on and try to do what I should do. But I cannot help but not know how to deal with the fact that I wasted months during grad school + when I fucking to a scholarship. I should have taken a leave of absence instead. Logically I know that there are some things that one should just move on from. And just deal with it and move on. At this point accept that shit happened, and try to do what I can. But how to deal with the whole mess up and how I obviously have to make a good impression. Where even right now, I am still struggling with getting my self to work due to developed ergophobia. --- Obviously step by step for this one. But dammit I cry. apologies for this long post.

"I think the worst thing about being bipolar is the mania (vent?) I’ve dealt with depression a lot. I hate it but it’s my normal. I recently went through 5 months of mania where I acted horrible. I did everything except have delusions of grandeur. I ended up being sexually assaulted which I believe shocked me out of it. I could’ve really hurt someone or even gotten myself killed. Now anytime I’m in a good mood I start panicking and crying thinking it’s coming back. That was my first manic episode and I was on a lot of Cymbalta during it. I also wasn’t officially diagnosed until after the fact. Im dealing with aftermath of my bad decisions and will be for at least a couple years because of the debt I racked up. I’ve been depressed all my life. Mania, however, scares me more than anything. I’m fairly certain that’s not the general consensus.",Bipolar

"Having no romantic relationships or prospects for one is eating away at me I am 24M and have never experienced anything of the romantic kind, not even crushes. I lost my teenage years due to isolation which is usually when people get introduced to this stuff. I've never even had female friends except some cousins.

I live in a culture where arranged marriages are the norm. I'm nearing the age when talk about marriage becomes more serious, especially for women. But I don't see myself ever getting married. I'll probably KMS before 30.

It feels like I will miss out on this part of the human experience because I'm so insecure around women. I saw a post that summarised how I feel perfectly:

&gt;I have trouble talking to women, in fact I can't even make eye contact with them, especially if I find them even a little attractive. I'm scared they'll think I like them and then they'll hate that someone as disgusting as me could like them.

I know that going into a relationship won't fix me but it's so gut wrenching knowing that you don't have the skills or prospects that can make it possible. It's stopping me from even trying to make friends with women, IF they think I like them they'll probably be disgusted by me. (Even though I'm scared to even let myself think that I might like someone)

I know that I should try to make friends with women first, but I'm afraid they might label me a creep sensing my inexperience with talking to women (let alone having female friends or a relationship). It's like I carry this secret with me like a badge of shame and I automatically defer any action about this to prevent myself from the humiliation that will result from it.

"Do people with bipolar ever feel better than just ok? I’m meeting with my doctor tomorrow and I’m thinking about asking for new medication to add on. 

I’m not sure what to say, though.

My mental health got worse after getting diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. 

I’m currently on Lamictal. It’s definitely helped. My issue is that I don’t know how to describe how I feel. I’m better than I was 6 months ago. I feel okay. But that’s just it. Just okay. Some days are better than others, but I’m alright. I feel like I need something else. But I wonder if just being okay is all I’m ever gonna get because I’m bipolar? Will I ever feel true happiness?

So December 30th of 2020 while I was laying in bed trying to fall asleep a feeling of loneliness and sadness came over me is the best way I could describe it and I figured by the time I wake up it would be gone, when I woke up the next morning I still felt that way and decided to get ready in the dark and on my drive up to work I did not have the radio on listening to music like I normally would, when I got to work I asked my boss which route I would be doing and I started typing in the addresses on my phone and whenever I type address is in I use voice dictation, so every time I would speak an address in that morning I kept feeling this urge like I wanted to cry and the more I kept speaking the stronger it got so eventually I started typing them in with my finger and several times before dispatch my manager walked past me and I wanted to tell him so bad that I was not feeling well mentally and that I was not all there I was so close to telling him yet I could not bring myself to do it so finally fast forward to after they dispatch us instead of telling my manager that I am not feeling well mentally I told him that I was hungover..... I felt like I would have been judged if I would have told him that I was not feeling all there mentallyAnd one more incident here recently happened where me and a friend went to a bar and on our way over there I kind of get this familiar feeling of like loneliness and sadness and when we get into the bar and sit down they ask what we want to eat and drink and I was not in the mood for anything so I did not order anything I pretty much just stared off into space while we were there and after we left the bar we walked around the little shopping center area that it was in and then before we got back to my truck there was a park nearby with two Bridges that cross over a trail so I told my buddy that I was going to go take a piss and I would be right back I walk in between the two Bridges and sit down on the embankment or whatever the hell you call that thing and then I cried for about 5 to 10 minutes for absolutely no reason whatever And the background I would say the end of 2019 or beginning of 2020 I had made plans to go play pool with a coworker and right before I got to the pool hall they Called said that they could not go so I ended up going by myself and stayed there until about 2:00 a.m. playing pool by myself realizing that I was getting more and more lonely I decided to leave and drive to the park on the way there the feeling got stronger and when I got to the park I shut my truck off and cried for about a good 5 minutes at least and texted one of my co-workers that he was better at his job than I was at mineI honestly do not know if I am depressed or just lonely, because that feeling is not always constant, it is not always persistent 24/7 I think I might have depression",Depression

"I had a test today that has been on the schedule for three weeks. I studied and studied and stressed over it to the point where my period was late for 7 days which has never happened before. It was all I could think about. After the flight (it was a flight test, in the air, I am an aviation major) when my instructor told me hes not passing me on the test, the disappointment I felt in myself was so immense. It took every thing I had not to burst into tears while he went through the flight and detailed every single thing that I did wrong. I tried so hard for this test, everybody I talked to about it said you will do great! you always do! you got this! it will be amazing! and I think that is another reason it hit me so hard , bc I was so fucking embarrassed. I do not fail things. The whole time he was talking I just could not stop the thoughts of how worthless and stupid I was. It just kept repeating itself over and over in my head, his mouth kept moving saying the reasons why I failed and my brain kept telling me that I should just kill myself there is no point in trying so hard if this is the result, I wanted to hurt myself so so so bad. For some reason there is a sharp blade in my car and a few weeks ago I discovered that its very effective in making myself bleed. Its kind of like a scalpel? Again, I do not know why its there but it is (I think its like an eyebrow shaper or something my sister left in there??) but anyways it was basically all I could think about. When I left, of course, as soon as I got in the car I could not stop the tears from falling, any sort of negative feedback from a parent, teacher, colleague, etc always hits me so hard. I HATE being critiqued bc I am a perfectionist so there is usually nothing to critique. But anyways I kept myself from cutting somehow, the scars have been adding up and I do not want anybody finding out, there is only so many times you can blame it on the cat, or a branch, or the dog, whatever. I still had to release that disappointment in myself though so I ended up slapping myself a lot which ofc made things worse. and my face still hurts. Lol the amount of times I almost flipped my car on the highway tho on the way back to my apt, man Ill tell ya, it was difficult to not. My dog is the only reason I am alive I swear, thinking about him was the only thing that kept me going. When I got back I cried some more then fell asleep next to my doggo. I still feel worthless and the thoughts are terrible in my head and I wish I were dead but here I am venting to random strangers on reddit bc I feel guilty thinking about how my family would react if they found out I was dead. Its not fair that I am alive right now, I do not want to be, so why do I have to suffer for the next eighty years. I think deep down its why I chose to become a pilot, so I could kill myself easily if I needed to. If my family were all dead, god, I would jump off a bridge so fast. Anyways, moral of this story which is my life is think twice before you fail a student or tell someone something bad about them, you do not know their frame of mind and you may just be the reason they needed to kill themselves. This is not even a fiftieth of all the reasons I want to die, but the fact that just failing this test which I can retake btw, triggered me so much, I just do not want to do life anymoreI have a head ache from crying so much its so weird I almost never cry but lately its been happening a lot more.

"In the meantime this girl texted asking what time he'd be there, but he didn't reply. Following day when she asked why he didn't reply/show, instead of sharing that he was saw me, he made up a story how he got stuck driving someone to the airport then followed with ""I wanted to see you more than anything."" At this point I royally freaked out and he said the reason he made up the story about driving to the airport was because now that it looked like he committed to attending, it'd be easier to  come up with some urgent non negotiable reason why he couldn't make it (rather than look like a jerk that ditched last minute for something else that popped up without giving any notice). Again understandable. I do buy the story because when the girl called, she told me nothing was going on beyond friendship and that they hadn't talked in forever, she said she herself was busy with a new relationship which why is they hadn't talked beyond simple texts here and there, which would explain why she didn't know he was dating me just until that moment.",Stress
"SO in need of help We have been together with break ups for 7 years. 
2 years ago we moved for a fresh start but I feel it was to get me away from friends and family as all I have is him now. He also now has little support. 
I am scared for my safety and though I love him I can't do this to myself no more. I want children and a house and this feels like it'll never happen. 
We have moved countless times from him damaging the houses or putting us in financial debt that we are then kicked out. We have been homeless from him not being able to accept help and choosing drugs. 
My jobs have been comprised from him going into work and abusing me having police show up or I become sick from no sleep or malnourished or crazy depressed. 
He is in and out of work for his family but really is just a pay cheque and he never goes to work so has no routine. Especially now days. 
I've had many police involvements and hospitalized from them and other times. 
This past year and a half has been nothing but a downward spiral and I feel I am an enabler and he does better without me because he has to stand on his own two feet when I'm not there. I feel like a mother more than a partner. 
Our current house is trashed inside and out. Actual mess and filth to house damage aswell.
He recently got out of hospital but his mania is still very high up. He spent all our pay on material things, drugs and the likes and we now have to paid rent that I'm aware of for 2 weeks. He goes out at all hours night driving around and from this his car has been in multiple crashes but won't tell me any details so we can't get insurance. It's still half drivable but suspended and I'm worried of him driving my car. 
I have most of my belongings in my car as he has said he will light the house in fire before being hospitalized and did try. 
I am extremely mentally drainage from all this and the way I am spoken to constantly. I am walking on egg shells and get no sleep as he hardly sleeps and does many OCD things to wake me up like flicking lights, rummaging through draws. Half organising or cleaning at inappropriate hours of the night. Physically waking me up to harrass me when his not driving around. I know his taken his meds and the hospital and docs just won't believe me that he isn't fine and his meds currently don't work anymore.  
I am sorry for the mess of this post. Hard to put 7 years of a very stressful realtionships in words and currently what's happening. 
How do I get out? I feel I have spent majority of the years trying so hard to help and also been a bad guy and an enabler which makes it hard too. But it gets harder and harder to see a future and happiness. 
I am scared he will try to hurt himself or follow me if I try.

"Anti-stress device research  Hello all,

we are a group of university students who are in the process of creating a functional prototype for patients with heart disease and/or anxiety disorders, as well as for people who lead a stressful lifestyle.

It is a relatively small wearable device placed on your chest that allows you to start a vibration in the chest area in the event of a panic attack to calm the heart, thereby helping you to more easily achieve cardiac coherence, which is proven to calm the organism.

"Bipolar &amp; Resilience Hey everyone,

I am far from a inspirational speaker but I wanted to just hop on and say that when it comes to my BiPD I feel I am a much stronger person because of it. I grew up with a mom who likely had the disorder as well but took the path to meth as her escape and my dad was always working and never there. 

I grew up on my own and didn't find out I had the disorder till I was in my late teens. I wasn't able to go to college and I struggled to find work that was a fit and take care of myself for a bit but now I am happy to say I found the best job and make more money without a degree than most.

This IS NOT me bragging, I say all of this to show that I think we all forget sometimes that while having this disorder is a struggle it can teach us a lot of lessons. It also allows many of us to think differently and that can be a benefit. The problem is finding a way to get to stability to be able to use it in a way that doesn't make us self-destruct. I know it's hard (understatement of the year), and everyone has to find thier own path because it is definitely not one size fits all. I hope anyone who sees this knows there is hope, it's the small wins that keep it alive. Small ones lead to larger ripples in life.

A deadly virus that costs about $70,000-$90,000 to cure. (I work an entry level retail job and can't afford it)

This diagnosis caused me to go from feeling on top of the world, and stable, to actively wanting to die, feeling that nobody wants me around or loves me, and splitting on everyone around me.

"separation anxiety in the recent few years i've very well acknowledged that i am a pretty anxious person and i kinda got used to it. but something that still bothers me is my separation anxiety and the constant fear of being abandoned by my friends. i don't know how to go about it, especially now that i have a best friend to whom i can't talk all the time, whenever i want or need to. they seem to be more of the avoidant style. i find it very difficult to go through my day if whenever i think of them and talking to them, i have to stop myself and 'give them space.' i don't mean this in a selfish way, naturally i am a pretty understanding person. i try to control my 'urges' for contact, which i crave a lot, but it's been getting harder as the days go by. most of the time i don't even have something important to say, it's just my thoughts and things i mention throughout the day, but i feel blue when i remember that they do not 'prefer' texting everyday because that is something that i really like, want and need. i try my best to respect their boundaries and i am the one to 'adapt' to their needs for space. just recently i started wondering whether it is okay that i bring this up as a boundary and a need of mine. i feel like i've often been the one to change for them and it's been getting to me lately. i don't mean any harm to my bestie and we don't have any other 'unsolvable' problem except for this one. is it okay to text them? is it selfish? i get a lot of thoughts and i address them as anxiety but it doesn't get any easier even when i am fully aware of that. i just wish to put an end to this. it has been affecting my mood lately, i check the messages app hundreds of times only to see no texts from them. i get anxious waiting for a reply and even more anxious when i first think of something to say. it just pops into my mind and i happily open the app but as soon as i start typing i remember the situation and feel guilty about texting them. but then again, i feel very empty if i don't. how do i go about this?",Anxiety
"Do you ever find your ""symptoms"" change or transfer to different areas? A couple of months ago I started getting this sharp pain in my upper right abdomen just below the ribcage. I'm 27 and regrettably eat a fair amount of takeout so naturally I assumed this to be gallbladder issues. I ended up getting it checked at the ER one night when I got some really sharp pains and found a ""bump"" in that area. The doctor was convinced the bump was just fatty cartilage and since the pains seemed to happen at random and not after meals that it was likely not my gallbladder. They scheduled an ultrasound anyway which turned up with no issues which I was happy about.

That said since then I started getting neck/back pain, which didn't really concern me given my crappy posture and I've always had a fair amount of neck tension. However in the past couple weeks I started getting random shoulder/arm pains that come just as quick as they go, and today i started getting quick sharp chest pains, though I'm convinced the chest issue comes from some recreational smoking last night with some friends.

"Being the crazy lady I’m 61 now and was diagnosed bipolar 1 at 28. It’s quite severe, I get psychotic and inhabit a whole alternate reality. Despite taking meds religiously all these years, and trying so many different combos, I still average one manic episode per year and they can go on for months. The consequences of the episodes have been serious, especially when younger. I haven’t been able to hold a job and am on disability. 

Unlike many of you that I see here I am often not able to ‘catch’ myself, and once it’s at a certain point I lose all insight and am belligerent if people try to suggest I’m not ok. Last year I seemed to have a good year and felt more hopeful and optimistic than for some time. But that came crashing down when I was suddenly arrested and dragged off to hospital in the New Year (I’d done nothing criminal but I guess I must’ve been acting strange). 

One of the hardest things for me is the shame and humiliation for how I acted when manic while being adamant that there was nothing wrong with me. In retrospect I could have been seriously harmed or worse when I used to roam around the streets at night and do risky things. Nowadays I mostly just post obnoxious nonsense online and get myself banned or blocked. I’ve lost friends, like many of us. That irresistible desire to communicate seeks an outlet, you know?

"(Tl;DR: I had two back to back suicide attempts and I feel like I died after the second one but nothing is there to prove it. I feel guilty about the amount that was spent on me in the hospital, and I am still immensely suicidal.) I had two attempts basically back to back, the first on June 1st of 2021 and then one on June 25th of the same year. Both of overdose on benadryl and prescribed Prozac. My first was alone on my favorite forest, I did it at 3 pm after I got off work and drove home at 11 at night. I was grounded for staying out past curfew and the friend B I had been 'messaging' during it (it was all gibberish on my part) had forgotten his phone in someone is car halfway through it. he is all I have. I was terrified the first time I tried to kill myself because of hallucinations, so the next attempt I did with him next to me. I got mad he stopped me, and a fight broke out. We drove to a nearby park and because he knew I would taken much more before and he knew I was afraid of the cops he just let me sleep it off in the bed of my truck while he was with me. He left me three hours in because a cop told us to leave (how the cop did not notice I was out of my mind is beyond me) so he drove home and thought I would have left the park but I just got back in and I drove back home at 4 in the morning. Went to bed, and woke up and I was still hallucinating so my mom took me to the hospital and then I was put in the phych ward for 8 days and put on new meds. I feel like I died this time. Everything feels so wrong. it is like everything is repeating itself. I do not know of its the new meds I was put on (which are not helping and I still want to die) or I did actually die or if I am just out of synch because everyone is tiptoeing around me because I am 'sensitive' all of a sudden.

I’ve been sick for awhile with a diagnosed but generally not serious sinus infection, but lately I’ve been noticing some other things (which I won’t mention so you don’t fall down the same hole Im in) and those things of course led me to the worst possible idea: Googling my symptoms.

Even though I went to my general practitioner for the sinus infection today and mentioned the other strange symptom, I didn’t mention the name of the specific thing I think I could have because it felt ridiculous and the symptoms were subsiding.

"Are those hallucinations? For a few months I've been having more paranoid moments, and they were followed by the feeling of seeing something moving in the corner of my eye. Sometimes I would see sudden movement on the very verge of my vision and it would freak me out, but after that I would always check the thing and it would be a charger slipping off the bed and such. The dark flashes (not the actual real moving stuff) would always leave me disturbed, but I always just freezed in shock and then I was able to rationalise it and calm down.
However, this week I was laying in bed with my partner and when I turned my face to the wall, in the shadow I saw a dark moving shape, like an animal or a black blob of darkness, crawling into the bed. My body immediately started screaming to the point of throat hurting afterwards, I was extremely terrified and scared about our safety. For the first time I was actually staring at something shadowy moving; it wasn't just a sharp movement in the corner of my eye, but something I could look at and it would still be looking absolutely scary.

"Back to the psychiatrist... I sat in the parking lot outside of work today and finally made another appointment with my psychiatrist after three months of quitting medication. I'm so tired of feeling depressed and *angry* and nauseous and paranoid. I'm in a mixed episode and my method of keeping my head down and waiting it out isn't working well for me.

Music sounds strange. Voices and lights are overwhelming. Road rage spills out of me and I'm horrified but unable to stop...and when I'm not behind the wheel my feet drag, I have trouble focusing, every small task a huge ordeal. I haven't cooked in weeks -- I'm either overeating or not eating at all -- and I'm spending way too much money on delivery and drive-thru's. I'm anxious and irritable and bitter and hopeless and yet I know, logically, that I have no reason to feel this way.

I was on medication for six months before I stopped taking everything cold turkey. The lamotragine and wellbutrin had helped a lot at first when I was in a similar state last spring, but I wasn't convinced that I needed them anymore (or that my bipolar diagnosis was even accurate) and I was a couple of weeks away from losing my insurance indefinitely.

It's been a whirlwind of a winter. I went through it all:

Euphoric hypomania around the holidays. Huge spending, not sleeping or eating, hanging out with everybody, falling in love, lots of drinking and partying and being merry. I could so easily sink karaoke in front of hundreds of my coworkers at the holiday party or confess my love for my best friend or *be curiously spontaneous*. 

Followed by a crash. Depression. Self medicating. Waking up with a feeling of dread. Not wanting to leave the house, go to work, get out of bed. I quit my food industry job, stopped hanging out with friends, stopped replying to texts and calls.

Started feeling better for a week or two before *bam* here we are. Mixed episode.

I'm not looking forward to tomorrow. I don't want to be on medication or accept that I have bipolar, but I'm willing to try if it gets me out of this horribly distressing mess. I don't know where to start except to post here and not be in the dark about what I've been going through these past few months (as well as the past decade). And I'm fortunate to have a wonderful psychiatrist. It helps with going back.

"i'm never gonna be loved by anyone... and i think that's okay. for a long time, all i wanted is to be loved by other people, but as a depressed individual, it's been kinda impossible to believe anyone will ever love me. and i don't even mean it exclusively in the romantic sense (how does a first kiss feel? i don't even know), but in the platonic sense too.

i don't even think i'm physically unattractive, but i do know my personality is unattractive, which is somehow *worse.* with this i am not saying i am unworthy of love, i mean that my goals in life and my way of being is not what it's expected of people nowadays. i have weird and extremely niche interests, i am weird and my only purpose in life is to collect the biggest spectrum of unique experiencies; definitely not the kind of people that attracts other people in this world (i mean ambitious people with dreams of financial gains, charismatic people, etcetera).

don't get me wrong, i love my weird quirky self, but so far nobody has ever loved my weird quirky self lol. i know there's lots of people in this big and wide planet, but it seems like i don't have the skills to find the people who will like me, the people who will form groups with me, the people who will desire me in a romantic way. and considering my age, i feel like it's too late to find those skills, the skills of making deep, meaningful, reciprocal connections with other people.

but i think that's okay. somehow, getting rid of the desire to form connections with others has made me happier with those small-talk friendships whom only talk to me about the weather or their job, with those classmates who only talk to me when i awkwardly join the bigger groups at college. maybe thinking that i'm worthy to be loved by other people is me asking too much?

the approach i'm taking now is to love myself. and with ""love"" i mean romantic love; i flirt with myself. i tell myself i'm beautiful, even if i don't recognize that person in the mirror as someone beautiful. i have lots of love buried in my heart, and i always waited to get into a relationship to give this love to someone else. now, i try to give it to my own self. there's days when i really want to die and i can't even get out of bed, and i ask myself ""what would i do if the love of my life felt like this?"" and i realize that i would support her; i would do everything to get her out of bed, help her bath and make some food for her. so i get out of bed, i bathe myself and make myself some food.

there's some days when loneliness hurts, though. i always see stories of the beauty of romantic love, of touching the lips of the person you would die for, feeling that person's chest and not caring if the world ends, as long as you're on their arms. stories of the joy of hanging out with like-minded people, and just being up at 4am enjoying each other's presence and looking at the stars together. these are experiences i will never live, and it hurts. and it makes me feel like this whole philosophy i just described in this post is just a dangerous coping mechanism.

but what would i do if the love of my life felt like this? i would hug them and tell them that it's gonna be okay. so i just tell myself that i'm gonna be okay.

He's always been a very good professional and never made me feel uncomfortable. Considering that I've known how he approaches therapy for 2 years now, I find it very strange that he has suddenly changed our boundaries - and without asking me. 

First thing, is that one day instead of a good bye handshake he said ""I'm going to hug you today"", and he did so. I didn't mind (goodbye hugging is very common in my culture) but I don't like that he didn't ask first if that was ok instead of just announcing it and going for it. 

He proceeded with doing this again after every session since then. Then last time he kissed me on the cheek (also common and non-sexual way to say goodbye in my culture) but still strange as he's never done it before. He also called me once to check on me and ask how I was feeling (I had just lost my dad so maybe that's fine) but he's also never done that before all these years. 

Today I cancelled our next appointment because something came up, and he said ok but I have to pay for it anyway, which I know some therapists do but 1) mine never does and 2) I cancelled way earlier than the timespan that would require me to pay.

"I despise my mom ( 22m ) Pretty much the title - I just can't stand her, I never liked her ever since I was a little kid but for me that hate went much higher beyond it.


Just to clarify, I don't think she is the abusive type - more like the overcontrolling and overbearing type of mom - the type that when you make a mistake or fail to do as she asks ( even if it's just the order of the way I put things in their place ) she will scold and do it herself - even if those are MY things ( she isn't satisfied with the way I put my clothes in my wardrobe or when I don't do it immediately) and barely have any respect to my privacy - In the past she wouldn't even let me close my own door so my room was always open, even this days she complain when I don't leave a gap ( but on that case I don't give a fuck anymore and barely leaves any - not a door you can close easily ) and she would always complain about im not normal or like 'the other kids/people' because I don't act or do things they do, and I cant forget her  'what you gonna do with your life, play on the computer all day? ' speech which she does when she remembers she needs to get mad or moody for no reason.

Im afraid of embarrassing myself in public, im afraid of even doing some of the basic stuff because I don't think I can do it or I'll make a clown out of myself - and it always comes back to how I was never really taught how to control my own life and be independent - even in the few times she did taught me anything she would still eventually take control and it doesn't make me motivated to even try. one of the reasons I eat in my room is because I just don't want to be around her because I will always get criticized for something - my beard ( which no one taught me how to do it, and my dad lives abroad ) , my ears, my hair, my clothes - everything. She always tries to pick things for me to wear and while today i do wear whatever I want regardless of her opinion/picks I still remember that when I was younger she would be upset and mad if I didn't wear what she wanted me to wear ( and she still kinda give the bitch look but as I said - I still wear what I wear ) and the judgement doesn't stop at that. Her favorite habit is that on events and gatherings she would always whisper in my ear what's wrong me in the moment - could be anything from noticing something dirty or not to her eyes that no gives a fuck about, the way I behave ( WhY YoU ARe NoT SmiLing ) and all other type of shit to make me lose confidence or be overly aware of my problems. She would always try to buy me stuff I don't want or asked to get and would always expect me to thank her even if sometimes she was the one that was pressuring me to get something.

When I think about all of this ( and other stuff ) I understand why im so incompetent, afraid of making mistakes or embarrassing myself and stuck in that avoident and depressive mind set. It's not all her - there are things I probably could've done myself ( and still can do ) and even without her the competitive and soulless society most of us are part of just adds a lot to the way we end up - and still - she has a part in why my life fucking sucks - and now I need to find a way to get back on track somehow.

Also, today I pretty much snapped at her in an unrelated case which eventually also happened because of all those feelings I stored inside. I don't talk to her and tbh it's such a good feeling.

"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",Depression
"Worried about the Flu. Hey guys, I've always been extremely worried about my health and I always think that something is wrong with me. The flu going around is quite severe, and for two days now i've been feeling a bit run down. My cough has not worsened in two days, and I have not run a fever. My glands in my neck are swollen, though. I am so worried that I have the flu. 
I never really worried about catching the flu, but since the strain this season seems to be killing many people, I am extremely worried.

"This is such a trite, bullshit phrase used by anti - suicide peopleThe help people need is often not available. The working world rules all and does not give allowances for mental health issues until they demand to be taken seriously usually by some act of irreversible damage..In theory I should have support. I see an occupational therapist (suspected to have ASD/ADHD) and a counsellor. They can try and work through my issues but they cannot do anything to help with the unrelenting stress of my job. And I cannot afford to quit. Useless. I cannot explain any of my issues to my boss. They have no power to change my job or provide help. Its just not that type of organization. It would be humiliating to discuss this with them too. Stress leave does not really exist. Would have to see a doctor for that. They all say they do not know me well enough to recommend leave. And it would not help me unless it means a change of job. Its useless to talk to my family. They cannot do anything practical. My dad continually downplays my illness or compared to his own or just thinks I get a little depressed. Tells me I should never feel I cannot take a vacation. A totally stupid thing to say. Talking to them usually just makes me angry. Help lines are totally useless. Never a practical suggestion. I just want to end it to prove a point to- my father who does not take me seriously- my therapist and OT and pysch and everyone else so they know it was serious. I was not faking. I really needed help. - big middle finger to my employer. They like to think they are progressive and care about employees mental health. I could seriously embarrass them. - let everyone else know how little they meant to me - end this charade of working hard to support a life no longer worth living. there is nothing worth the bullshit I put up with. Obviously I want help but it clearly does not exist! And do not bother reporting concern to Reddit what good does that do. ? Ask for help yeah right from who or what ?",Suicidal

"""just ask for help"" isn't working I am \*curse word\* struggling. 

&amp;#x200B;

Background: I have been diagnosed by a PCP since 2012 with MDD, GAD. In 2016, I started seeing a male PCP in the south who told me he would handle my diagnosis unless he felt I needed to see a specialist. He changed me from Celexa to a high dose of Prozac, increased my Seroquel, put me on upto 9 Xanax a day, as well as Klonpin. Diagnosed me with ADHD, and started adderall. He changed my meds a few times saying I did not need to wean off or on as they were in the same family....I ended up in ER twice. Had several Manic breakdowns/hysterical fits (i didn't consider bipolar at the time), lost time....then over christmas, he left and the other dr refused to process my xanax refill and I went through 2 weeks of withdrawal. When he returned, he apologized and said, ""I'm surprised you're here, most people don't make it through that alive without hospitalization....I stopped going outside of needed refills. In 2018, I had no insurance and my partner and I decided I would probably be okay going off meds for a bit, and use cannabis (legal here) as the previous Dr had suggested. 

&amp;#x200B;

That is when things got bad. My symptoms blew up, and I started changing (I also turned 25). I've never been an ""angry"" person, not even when I should be. All of a sudeen I couldn't make it through work. I couldnt think. My moods were changing, and I would have a week or two, and then literally not be able to do ANYTHING for weeks. The house started getting messier, I wasn't cooking or eating, canceling shifts left and right, couldn't think or read through anything....My partner started expressing conern over my need to ""at least get back on seroquel and adderall"". In august, our dog died traumatically. PTSD symptoms fllared. My partner has BPD, anxiety, and depression that is not medicated. His anxiety sending me into full panic attacks and anger. 

&amp;#x200B;

I got insurance this year, and January I requested an appointment with a PCP. She immeadiately referred me to a Psychiatrist and Psychologist. First available appointment for therapy is March 25. Med appointment with Psych not available until April 9. Doctor calls and asks for urgent appointments. psych calls and says they can make an exception and get me in on April 7, I decline as 2 days isn't enough to move my off request from work. PCP has me come in to address medicine and for ""safety checks"", mentioning inpatient options. I can't do that. It is not an option. I have laid out my sypmtoms and cited that my sister and father have Bipolar disorder. My chart says ""Bipolar 2 suspected but not formally diagnosed, depression, anxiety, adhd nos.)

&amp;#x200B;

Today I went in, telling her it seems my depression has improved marginally but my anxiety has been horrible and constant. shaking constanty, not sleeping, headaches, and picking my skin on my face and arms worse than I have in a year (i skin pick with anxiety). She ups the limotrigene literally making me take more in the office, ultimate goal of upping to 200 mg in two weeks. She puts me back on Seroquel, and then tells me she would like to take me off the adderall and wished she had not started it as she attended a conference for ""patient's in crisis"" and they expressed the need to treat Bipolar or other disorders before ADHD and adderall. Says it may be part of the anxiety. I tell her I think it is a bad idea as it is the only improvement I have had to mood, ability to get out of bed, and work- and it seems to sometimes help the anxiety probably because I can think somewhat clearly. She then tells me to come in next week, and that the psych doc may completely change my meds in two weeks, and he or she may still take me off of Adderall. Hopes the seroquel will aid in sleep, picking, and anxiety, as well as upping the limotrigine. Perscribes me nothing for the panic, constant anxiety, not even refilling the 5 mg of Lorazepam she previously would give me 5-10 at a time. To be fair, I told her it wasn't doing much of anything and I did not ask for a refill today- thinking she would perscribe SOMETHING to help me.

&amp;#x200B;

I am completely overwhelmed. I have been screaming for help for months and all I have been able to get from it has been constant med changes (which I know is a thing but....), wants to take me off the only thing that is helping, and just basically having them hope I'll make it through until the med appointment, and checking weekly to see if I have killed myself or been admitted yet. The idea of going off the adderall literally crushed me. The mention of starting completely over was too much. I was literally crying and shaking the entire time I was in the appointment. I didn't ask for this. I am barely holding on. My social life is gone, I can't make any commitment by the time it comes up either from anxiety, depression, or complete exhaustion. I didn't ask for this. I can't enjoy things. I can't breathe or stop shaking. My mouth is twiching from constantly holding it in a weird position to prevent my chin from shaking. I'm falling apart and everyone see's it, but there is nothing they can do? How am I supposed to do this? Killing myself wouldn't even matter. It would make everything worse for the people already suffering from me, I'd just be another number on a statistic sheet, and other people would still go through this. I have lost 13 friends, 10 to suicide. One was a fucking psychologist.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; this process of waiting and changing meds while waiting for 3 months for psych is too much. Any help appreciated. Even just empathy or your experience. Thanks &lt;3",Bipolar
"Swollen lymph node, goes away as fast as it inflames \*\*Repost from AskDocs

As far as i remember, this began this past summer. One of my armpits would get a painful feeling, almost as if I pulled a muscle or so, but no lump or anything. Then a couple of days later, it would be painful and a lump and what I figure to be a lymph node. It's never more than 1 inflamed at a time under 1 armpit. It used to be just the left, but this morning I woke up with one under my right. I would say the frequency is about 1 flare up every 2 to 4 weeks, moreso on the side of a month. And no bigger than a pea, or maybe M&amp;M. I can't really tell since I touch it, but sometimes the skin appears reddish underneath, sometimes it doesn't. They eventually go down again and no pain and it feels fine. I don't ever have any symptoms of being sick, as in cough, fever, chills, etc. Everything is pretty normal beside the lymph node (if it is that) flaring up. So, something more serious to worry about and go see my PC or just let it be? Could they be cysts that flare up and then go back down? It's not the same lump either, the location changes too. I do have history of healthy anxiety (my fear is lymphoma) and i've been to the doc plenty of times this past year already and would rather not for something like this, especially when it goes away.

I should mention, not sure if this matters, but I had changed deodorants around the same time frame, from deo/antiperspirant to just a deodorant. Anyone got an idea?",Anxiety
"About a month ago my best friend was laying on train tracks with a boy and got hit and died. Her funeral was one of the hardest days of my life. I still think about her every day but today I feel some extra grief and just cannot leave my bed. I have been doing better lately, I have a nice job and a perfect boyfriend that would do anything to help me. But I do not like telling him when I am down, because what is he going to do. He cannot drive yet so it is not like he can come to give me a hug. I would rather sleep all day until I can see him tomorrow. I asked him the other day if we could go to her grave and sit for a while, and he offered to buy me lunch after so we are doing that tomorrow. I have a lot of other thoughts floating in my mind that I cannot figure out which one is the root of my sadness. Maybe my past trauma? The fact that I am so impulsive I tell everyone things I do not want anyone to know. The fact that I feel like should not be allowed to go out and talk to people anymore. Even though it is definitely too late, everyone knows my darkest traumas. I feel so much guilt, so much grief, so much pain. But I will be fine tomorrow right? Like always, or is this the beginning of my next depressive episode. I even feel guilt in my relationship, if I have to lie to him or break his trust just to wish I could tell him everything and run into his arms. I feel safe with him, I could tell him If I wanted to and I probably will if he is not busy.

I have an intake tomorrow for a rehab clinic. I’m addicted to Xanax. I think the addiction is just a result of my mental problems that are really complicated and go far back into the past. After the rehab I will go to Portugal for an intense treatment for 2 months all by my own. No phones allowed. I think it’ll do me really good and I’m glad I have this opportunity. I know they aren’t going to fix my problems and I need to do it myself but it is a big step for me to travel alone. To really work on myself. It’s a step forward. I have had really bad weeks but this is a little bit of hope for me.

"sensations seemingly in heart Hi all! Do any of you ever have fleeting sensations coming from your heart? I can't find anything about it online so I figured I would ask folks here. The sensations I get aren't necessarily painful, but they give me anxiety as I feel like something is wrong with my heart. I have a history of stimulant use but I have long since said fuck off to those. This normally happens right when I wake up and get out of bed if at all. I'm 24 and am in pretty good shape.

"Negative self-centeredness This applies to social anxiety disorder, and many other mental illnesses, but if the sense of self is so negative, it also creates a negative perception of other people, and applies it back onto oneself, as the center object, even if self-esteem is low and esteem for others is idealized. It's important to teach people to have positive self-esteem regardless of what other people, but also to challenge the perceptions of other people in the first place.",Personality disorder

"So, long story short my parents are terribly abusive, I'm almost 30 and it took me this long, with the help of my wife to realize this. Lots of things happened, too many to list in a single post, but it got much worse last year when my daughter was molested by my younger brother. We had asked my parents to watch my two daughters due to a medical emergency, and that's when it happened, with my father in the room, his eyes glued to his cell phone. We involved CPS, the police, but my daughter didn't quite tell the police everything, and with their investigation, they could not press charges against him. After their investigation was complete, we informed my parents of what happened, and they called my then 5 year old daughter a liar to her face.",Stress

"Near death experience that wasn’t real So I’m bipolar (if that wasn’t obvious from the get-go) and I was coming home from a trip with my Mom on a plane. I had a really amazing weekend and I was feeling happy but not manic but then I started getting very sad for no reason on the way home (just assumed it was another mood swing). Then, I had an extremely bad delusion where I was convinced that the plane was going to crash and we were all going to die. I was laying my head on my Mom’s shoulder, I told her I loved her, and I just silently cried while thinking about how this is the calm before the storm. In my head I was telling myself, I can’t believe we’re all about to die and I’M the only one who knows. I actually accepted death, and embraced it (not in a suicidal way) in a way that I had never ever done before and it was like I finally felt at peace. I had emotions that I had never come close to. When we experienced turbulence I closed my eyes and thought “this is it, this is when it happens” and waited for the screaming and the overhead announcements. I thought of the baby crying and how it never got to experience it’s life and how my mom would never finish her book, how my sister would react when she found out her closest family had died. After we landed safely I felt a weird mix of disappointment and relief. I didn’t want to die- but I had expected it to happen so much it felt wrong that it didn’t. After that I got that post-delusion state where everything kind of feels like a dream for awhile. But now I feel like I had a near-death experience that wasn’t real and I’m not sure how to move on from it. I feel like I should’ve gone down with that plane and now life just seems a little off.

Sudden paranoid feeling that I have never experienced in 10 years living with anxiety disorder Wondering if anyone has had a similar experience whilst having an anxiety disorder where they felt a sudden paranoid feeling. I was trying to fall asleep at night and switched off my lights.

"Horrible Fear of Food Being Drugged Lately I’ve been having this massively irrational fear of my food being laced with LSD or some other form of psychedelics.  I won’t eat something that’s been already opened regardless of whether or not it’s mine, which has led to me not only wasting food, but actively avoiding eating unless I make it right there, and even then it takes quite a bit of effort.  This in turn has also led me to having a fear of an undiagnosed mental illness, and I can’t quite afford to go to a doctor currently to figure out if that is the case.

I’ve only ever been technically “drugged” once when the cannabis my friend bought was laced with PCP a few months ago but this fear extends back to when I was around fifteen (twenty three now).  I’ve done acid only twice and while I did enjoy it, it’s not something I’m likely to do again, and I rarely smoke cannabis or drink, but I did do a lot of both for a few years.

  Obviously nobody is gonna waste good acid on me but the fear is constantly there to the point that I yelled at my brother the other day for jokingly pretending to drop something into my Gatorade on the way to work (he’s unaware of this fear) and threw it away despite it being completely full, and even avoided eating the cookies my mom brought down for Christmas, which made me feel awful as there is absolutely no way my mom would ever do anything like that to me.

I’m iffy on telling anybody close to me about this fear for a few reasons, the main one being the irrationality of it all, but I also do not want to be sent to an inpatient center (again, can’t afford it) as I was for depression as a minor.  Sorry for the rambling wall of text but I just need to know if this is signs of a more major illness or at the very least how I can possibly cope with it.",Anxiety

Why is AVPD considered a personality disorder and not a mental illness? So from what i have read seems like AVPD is the only pure ego-dystonic personality disorder and usually personality disorders are seen as a flaw in someone's personality and are ego-syntonic in nature but in the case of AVPD seems like no one likes to have this condition. So why isn't AVPD considered a mental illness because the symptoms of someone with AVPD seems to match up with different things like social anxiety and extreme low self esteem?

"If you read the title read it once again.What I am saying below is depressing but it is not a lie.Does anyone feel like they are never living in the present, I sure do. I live my life chasing hopes and solving problems I have mostly caused myself, trying to better myself everyday and becoming someone I should be in my own mind. But there is always that thought that everything could end in a matter of seconds and I know that is very possible to happen.So that leaves me with this mission I feel I will never solve, if I am chasing all these dreams and always trying to become someone I want to be. What does that make of myself today. Would I ever be at peace in death if it were to happen today? Or would i be on my mission still, trying to become the perfect version of my self which in my head has existed many times. But yet I would always judge my own thoughts and feel like I should do 'better' even when I have reached a goal that I once visioned to be the perfect me.I chase and I chase, I feel purpose in being something more than I am every single day, I tell myself I am not happy or i will never be at peace until I fulfil these visions. But each vision I see and claim I still feel the fucking same way, one thing ends and its on to the next to fulfil myself as the last vision was nothing more than a stepping stone in my own mind. It leaves me with the question that has surfaced during every vision I have ever had and that is would I be happy if I were to die today? Or would I be worthless as I never took the steps I told myself to do. Ill be fucking honest if you have related to what I just said it can only end one way, that way I have figured out today. The way it ends is in helpless hope for happiness and fulfilment, to reach the perfect version of yourself to be someone that you have dreamt of which will only be a fragment of the life you once lived, nothing more than energy from your own mind. Nothing to anyone else, nothing to yourself. Sure as hell nothing to the future of this world. We are here because we were born to be, lead upon a life of confusion and misled instructions. To be a 'human' the only species that could ever think and do for themselves as far as we know. Alone on this world and on a mission to become a superior race. To dominate this earth to conquer our solar systems. To become gods at the end of it all as far as I know in my own head.But that will not happen for a very long fucking time, all we are today is hurdles, paths forged by our own thoughts to lead us hopefully to a blissful fairytale of immortality, where we could all live with our loved ones and remember the best times of our lives for an eternity.The problem with that is that we are never living our best times because we are chasing and chasing our better selves to bring peace. Which is ultimately pain in the end.So to end all of this my final mission is to tell all of you that life is nothing, nothing more than a figment of your mind, nothing more than fake instructions to be what you are. At the end of everything you are alone, lifeless and empty, nothing more than a past present to the future and what will the future be? The same fucking same thing.We are all here to live and die. Everything single thing along the way may bring the slightest and I mean slighted change to the future of life. The rest of it is just a delusional thought you have created to feel some sort of peace in your life until you reach the end where you hope, hope to be in a fucking dream world Knowing all this makes me feel numb, worthless and non existent and if you have related to what I just said you would feel the same. But that is very likely to be what this life is. There is nothing else along the way other than false hopes and sad endings, I am sorry for myself for having to be here and I am sorry for everyone else that is on the same ride with me. We wish we were more but that is beyond us. This is the dark truth of the world. It revolves around energy and we are just feeding it until it ends its own fate.So enjoy the ride, fulfil every hope you have and never stop doing so as I am sure it will make this easier. If you cannot stop changing yourself the world will simply do that for you. Which is being in death before you are dead. The way I feel about life.

"The older I get all I can do is laugh at the sheer absurdity of life. I wake up, eat breakfast, work a soul crushing job for 10-12 hours, go home, eat dinner, shower, sleep, and do it all over again. I am supposed to be grateful for what I have, but I am not. I hate nearly every detail of my life. I want to make changes, but that seems like an insurmountable task. I have shut myself off from everyone except for my SO, but I have been keeping them at arms length too. I will not let anyone get close enough to see just how knackered I am by life. The numbness I feel is only topped by the bitterness that caused it. When my fractured mental state is on the verge of collapse I just start laughing uncontrollably. I see now that none of it matters, I am just another grunt trying to make enough money to survive. If anything happens to me, only a few will be affected. I have suicidal thoughts, not tendencies, at least not yet. I think of death almost non-stop. I welcome the idea of dying almost every waking moment, try to keep myself distracted from it, not always successful. I honestly think I died 10 years ago and have been stuck in limbo, would certainly explain the absurdity of the last 10 or so years. But if that is not true then I must be insane or delusional at the very least. I go down that rabbit hole on a near daily basis. I am not even sure I want life to be real anymore. Maybe I am just trapped in someone is imagination or vivid dreams. What is real life, how do I return to it, or do I stay trapped in this cycle of trying to break free of some self imposed prison for mistakes I made years ago. I cannot always distinguish fact from fiction, but I also feel like I am just punishing myself. Pushing my mental state further and further down into the abyss. My moments of clarity shine through and I see how silly and trivial it all is, but then I slip right back into this farce of an existence afterwards. Life seems like a sick joke",Depression

"Has anyone else experienced catatonic symptoms when very low? About a year ago when I was in a very low period, I was hospitalised on 3 separate times where I was unable to move, speak or pretty much function which lasted for about 6 hours. Before these episodes set in, I remember being heavily suicidal and feeling hopeless and like I had no energy at all (like I was melting into the chair), and then seeing visuals in my surroundings.

The bit that is funking with my head is whether my mind is playing tricks on me and I could actually move and speak but I was pretending or whether it was all legitimate.

the last days after i got officially diagnosed with anxiety disorder i went without any symptoms (i guess finaly having a name for my problems calmed me down).

But two hours ago when i came back from a walk my left back side under the rib started to hurt :/

It not a stinging pain or something that i can't manage, but it feels a little bit like back pain and is slightly pulsating i think??

It also radiates a little bit to the right side and i am feeling a bit dizzy/out of myself right now :(

I went to pee and it came out like normal without any pain, so It shouldn't be my kidneys right?

"Choice Theory tl;dr should I read Choice Theory or should I change therapists?

So, my therapist has suggested that I read Choice Theory by William Glasser... I used a credit on audible to get it, it is a little over 12 hours long... I haven't started it yet, but what I have read about choice theory tells me I will disagree with a main premise, which my therapist and I kinda got into today...

He insists that thoughts and emotions are choices. Going so far as to say that mental illness is a choice. In regards to bipolar, if you are not having negative consequences, do you have bipolar? Because you can choose your actions and reactions and emotions and thoughts.

That medicine is a crutch and is not necessary.

He says that this gives you the power to control your life and swings and even get rid of swings.

This came up when I was asking about tools because my regular tool for dealing with intrusive thoughts isn't really cutting it for me right now (having the thought, then saying to myself, is this thought beneficial/useful/helpful to me?)

There are several things here that I am in complete disagreement with. Medicine is necessary, thoughts and emotions are not controllable (i.e. they just happen, but can potentially be directed) and, mental illness is real and not a choice.

Sure you can do things to help mitigate symptoms and try and improve yourself, but ~~I am pretty sure~~ I will always have bipolar. He has planted a seed of doubt.

yes 
no 
sure

I know that the meds aren't a cure all and that relapse happens, but recently have had a string of events (good, bad, and otherwise) have caused my depression to come back in full swing. I recognize it for what it is and why I feel like this, which is a huge step compared to before, but it's just as heavy and still rather difficult to deal with unlike my mania where I  know just to tune it down. I don't really know what I'm looking for in this as i have a pretty solid support system, but I guess if anyone else has had relapse experiences post medication I think hearing about others dealt with hearing about it would be helpful. Because I'm really in a spot where Im really not sure how to approach it and could probably use some netflix/movie suggestions as I don't have much energy to do anything else.

"More Trouble Than I'm Worth Without going into much detail, here's a little context:
Happily (as much as BPD allows) married to a wonderful man, and we have a beautiful, brilliant toddler. They're so good to/for me - I often feel undeserving. 
I've been in a depressive episode for almost 2 months - med compliant, have been for 3 years. 

Lately, I've been fucking up little, typical people things; scratched the car, got scammed out of $300, letting food go bad in the fridge... They're hitting my self-worth hard for no other reason than my low threshold for disappointment and my high expectations of myself. 

The latest thing is a creepy message left on my front door on Valentine's Day saying they saw me in the area and wanted to leave their number/Facebook in case they never saw me again.... WTF. Of course my husband is pissed, and I feel like my privacy has been 100% violated. Husband is SO upset that he has a hard time seeing how this affects me - but besides that, I feel like I'm way more trouble than I'm worth. 
My constant emotional turmoil, the fatigue, prescription drug costs, migraines that make me worthless for hours. 
I feel like I should just be alone. Like the people I love shouldn't be subjected to my bullshit and have to clean up my messes or pay my debt when I die (just got denied life insurance for BPD diagnosis). 
I have a lot of supportive people in my life, family, friends, therapist. Regardless, I can't shake this worthlessness, self-loathing guilt. 

Thanks for reading if you do, just having a rough... life right now. I know this probably sounds whiny - I have an objectively great life that I've worked hard for. Why do I still feel so shitty? ",Bipolar
"Back here again Damn colon cancer.

I'm afraid again and it seems more palpable than ever. This started two years ago after getting some blood work done. I got in my head that I could have colon cancer.

All my symptoms began after all results were good. I started having some light blood on my stool (a line here and there). Then my right lymph node grew, then shrunk, then grew and so on (it's still swollen but smaller). Then I started having diarrhea and watery dolls with a feeling of incomplete evacuation. Then I started noticing my skin is getting pale, more visible veins.(I sometimes see myself going from normal to pale to normal a couple of times in a day). I do the palmar crease pallor test almost constantly now.

I noticed that my fingernails were either pale or blue - ish sometimes (started thinking of iron deficiency and that scares the cap out of me).

Then I started feeling weaker, tired, after very little effort (should note that I put on 10 kg in this time). Arms started feeling weaker, got some armpit pain, chest pain, etc.

Then my back started hurting. My lower left back. Sometimes my lower right too. Then it started hurting more and more often. Now it hurts along my left leg as well as left hip. I read a post a while ago that said the op was diagnosed after very similar symptoms, so naturally I started freaking out again.

Now I'm seeing some similar stuff with my dad and it really drives me back to freaking out.

I don't know how to explain it but I'll do my best, so. Behind my chin underneath my jawline, one side is more swollen than the other when I tense my neck muscles. I first discovered it when I was prodding my neck, it's very pronounced when I tilt my head to the side. I tilted my head to the left, tensed my muscles and it felt like a huge mass under my jaw. I can feel a similar shape on the left side of my neck but it's nowhere near as big. It looks big in the mirror too.

"[Question] Burned out but boss loves my ability and will continue to incentivize if I do more TLDR : 3 questions at end regarding how to not care to disappoint when team and boss have seen my abilities. Boss has high aspirations for me this year or which if I fulfill I’m going to stretch myself so thin that I will leave or go into depression.


I was given a rather good yearly review, and well incentivized, but I am currently stressed, and trying to figure out how to have less responsibilities, when it’s desired I have more. This is above and beyond the rest of my team.

Boss sees my “potential” and not only wants it to continue, but also have me lead more, be more of a driver and influencer, and upgrade my knowledge, cross-team visibility. All of which I do not want. Taking on any more work feels like I’m going to “pop” and I’m already near / at burnout.

I hate disappointing and failing (why I try harder than others on my team; and also why I’m hate being in this position I am right now) but I’m at my max currently near / in burnout, thinking or ways to get out. My mindset is that I’d rather quit a 6fig job and go elsewhere / take a break than disappoint and fail someone whom believes in me so wholeheartedly, and knows how fast I can operate.

Sadly I’ve “shown my hand” this past year of what I’m capable of, but it’s unsustainable for my stress levels, needed downtime, and resetting ability. And more is desired. I’ve mentioned already to the boss that I’m burning the candle at both ends, but it’s only been sprinkled throughout the year. I also hate that I would them regret providing a large optional incentivized reward. Additionally if I fail it’s most likely no more of that and I would just be considered “middle of the road”. I’m OK with that if someone didn’t know my abilities, but again I have pushed past 120% capacity many times for tight deadlines and to get things done.

- How do I change my mindset to not care about disappointing 
- What, if anything, do I tell boss? I feel I need to drop hints that this is too much and if I’m dead it does no one good. ( absolutely sucks feeling capable but also having a hapicapied weakness of stress leading to depression.)

And she cannot become the people i need her to be and her words are starting to sound like whispers compared to the screaming pain.

"I'm screwed, maybe many of you are too? One thing I'm aware of is after you've been disconnected from societal norms for a few years, it seems very difficult to return. I tend to stay away from looking at other people's lives, overall it is good but you also need an awareness of how far adrift you are and the standard you're compared against.

The average person is socially active, whereas were disengaged. They have a constant stream of chores hobbies events plans, messaging circles. In a day some days I speak to no one and can't even find the motivation to do anything new, even something like watching a movie I can put off. My point is that after a while when you look at the ''activity level'' of a normal average person I just feel inadequate. This is made worse reinforced by the fact that whenever i do try connect with others I get rejected thats because they can sense pretty early I have nothing going on for myself in these social areas and I am not so much like them. And thats the catch-22 because people excluding you stops you ever having anything.

I'm incapable of organising a fun life, things, like viewing someone in family gathering and getting along with large groups of people and creating a good impression, are intimidating,nearly impossible for me.

"A person with health anxiety did the 23 and me health test and doesn’t know how to deal with the results. Hi everyone. I am a 20 year old female. Long story short I watched my grandpa, who has been my father figure all of my life, die of a heart attack suddenly after years of going to the cardiologist for monthly checkups being told he was fine. Since then, I’ve had debilitating anxiety which has mostly caused me to be a serious hypochondriac. You name it, I thought I had it. I’ve been through all the typical anxiety symptoms that have caused me to go to countless doctors getting brain scans, blood tests, etc. I’ve never checked out therapy due to always going to medical doctors. When they can’t find anything I don’t trust them I fear them from what they did to my grandpa. I stay up at night thinking about how they didn’t find something that is seriously wrong with me like the cardiologist couldn’t find my grandpas heart attack before he died from it. I have such a fear of death it’s probably insane. 

My main question here is this: I got a 23 and me kit with the ancestry + health for Christmas (like most people!) I was never worried about Parkinson’s since it was never talked about on my moms side of the family. I don’t know my dad personally, I only know of him. I knew he was Italian (which matched to what my reading was saying) but I never knew anything else. I had 2 variants detected in my health report. One major variant detected for Parkinson’s the GBA gene and one variant for Gaucher’s disease (meaning I’m a carrier.) When I say I was shocked I mean I was shocked. My mother never mentioned anything about Parkinson’s on either of my sides. I linked my results up with my moms results (she also had the test) and she also has a variant detected for Gaucher’s disease (she gave it to me I’m guessing) but she doesn’t have one for Parkinson’s only I do. 
The more research I do the more I want to cry. From what I’ve been reading I understand that I am at a high risk for Parkinson’s from my gene being a GBA and having Gaucher’s. I see that I am at risk for early Parkinson’s the one that causes the most cognitive decline very early in life. I have health anxiety to begin with (yes I know I probably shouldn’t have done the test) but I really was never expecting THIS. I don’t know where to go from here or what to think. I don’t know what I should do. All my research through various websites, scientific journals, and forums are telling me about what high of a risk I have for early Parkinson’s. I can’t sleep at night after finding this information. My heath anxiety has been through the roof. How serious is this? 
Please no judgement.

"Waiting 6 months and counting for any mental health treatment in the UK I moved back to the UK from the US about two years ago. Back in the states I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 and put on meds. When I moved back I thought I was ok and didn't need help. That turned out not to be the case and in August of last year I went to a GP and asked for anti-depressants. He said he wouldn't prescribe them to me and said it would be best if I see a mental health specialist and he did the referral. That took until January and in the meantime my depression got worse, I got fired from my job due to the symptoms and started putting weight back on. I would see my GP each month and beg for just a week or two of anti-depressants, he didn't budge. 

The referral came through in January and I got an appointment in the middle of February. It was just an intake appointment, the Doctor there said he didn't want to prescribe anything until I had blood work done, that was another 14 days. That's finally done and I now have an appointment booked in the middle of April where hopefully I'll get a prescription. 

I'm a big proponent of universal health care in the US but honestly, I don't understand how people in the UK with mental health issues survive. Waiting so long for something as simple as anti-depressants is shocking to me and has taken a huge toll. At this point I'm tempted to move back to the States as this would have been resolved in a week or two back there. I'm trying to hold it together but I'm starting to fall apart without treatment.

The world would be such a better place if we did that.I am tired of having to stand up for myself and I am tired of fighting this pointless battle. Nobody should have to do that. I am tired of crying every time something bad happens and I am tired of just being here. HUMAN BEINGS HAVE VALUE and I do too. I am NOT LESS THAN ANYBODY OR ANYTHING and I deserve better. And so do all of you. I am so depressed - it is insane,Depression

"My family has given me so much, but also taken away so much more than that. I cannot even lie down on my bed in self-pity for thirty minutes without people shouting at each other, and then treating me like they are the only one with problems, and never allowing me the freedom to express my sorrows. My outer family probably thinks I am someone who has had life too easy, and honestly, they are probably right in many ways. I love most of my friends, but I can never talk to them about my personal life, because I have built a facade of being an emotionless goofball. Even moments where I stay quiet for more than five minutes are enough for people to assume something is not going right with me, so how can I ever tell them what is really going on?My co-workers think I am pleasant and nice, but probably assume my personality is non existent. I am in line to have terrific job prospects once I graduate, yet I could not care less. Even after a post-puberty transformation that makes me a fairly decent looking person, I have never had a girlfriend, largely due to the insecurities I have maintained through my puberty years, when I was flat out ugly. Dating sites have horrible response rates, and even if I feel like there is a good conversation going, I always end up getting ghosted.there is also the fact that I am non-binary and in the closet, but cannot see a reality where I am able to love this part of myself, have a loving partner embrace me for who I am, or accepted my by family.I feel incredibly silly even writing this, because of how much privilege I have had through my life. I do not think I will ever end up taking my own life, because I am too much of a coward, and it would crush everyone I know, yet no one knows anything about who I really am. Yet I think about it everyday... when I wake up, after work, when I am with my friends, going to bed, you name it. Seriously, why the hell do I have to exist? Just let me disappear",Suicidal

i m 0 and i m alone and it s tough to pretend i m a whole person amp x 00b i haven t made a friend since high school i m starting to befriend someone at work but it s giving me a lot of anxiety because when am i going to say the thing that make her hate me it feel like i have to do everything right to be social or maybe i m missing something that everyone else ha or maybe i m just not cut out to be social but to have friend you have to answer them when they fucking text regardless of what s going on in my life and i just don t have the energy to keep up with that i recently had someone tell me i wa probably not doing well on bumble bff because i m a slow responder sometimes i don t know what to say sometimes word aren t happening in my brain sometimes i m just too tired maybe missing out on social thing for all of my 0 s is something i m never going to be able to recover from amp x 00b i ve been in a lot of workplace where i wa the loser i had no friend i d catch people saying mean thing about me they all get together with each other and i m not invited i ve been in multiple situation where group of people don t like me and do shitty passive aggressive thing to me every chance they get i don t know what i do wrong i try to just be a genuine kind person i get feedback that i m nice i know i m not perfect but at least i ve had some feedback that i m not totally delusional to think i m a nice person but there have also been a few time where i know what i said there have been a few time when i can pinpoint the off comment that make someone turn on me and it must be more than one off comment because it s always easy for that person to get a group to turn on me it s terrifying to feel like at any moment i can slip up and someone will just decide i m not worth their time amp x 00b and i never feel like i say the right thing some of my coworker s response are lackluster think lol and i just wonder if she even want to talk to me making friend give me the same anxiety that trying to date someone give me that s kind of fucked up i should probably not care so much whether or not someone decides they want to be my friend but also it affect me i feel like i m not worthy of friendship because so many people have decided i m not worth their time and honestly this is a big moment for me because this is the moment i realize i ve internalized all that rejection and got to where i don t feel good enough for friendship why would someone pick me when i m a ball of nerve why would someone want to hang out with someone who only feel like half a person amp x 00b lately i ve been doing okay relative to the last 0 year i finally got a job that doesn t feel like chinese water torture i m on medication and that help a ton i m a lot better about not letting myself slip into negative thought pattern this week i haven t been feeling the overwhelming cloud of misery because i finally got medication that isn t expired and i m taking it regularly but every time i think about social stuff it just give me this squished feeling i can t name the feeling but it s visceral my body feel shitty i m going on a vacation with my mom and her work friend in a month and i m so fucking nervous because what if i do the thing that make everyone hate me i don t even know what the fucking thing is but spending four day with people who are talking crap about you in a small space i did that around this time last year and it wa so bad amp x 00b okay amp x 00b i m a solution oriented person and part of my problem is that i don t know how to fix this part of my life i don t really know what the solution is to feeling unworthy of friendship it took me eight year to figure out the solution to hating myself and honestly even though it s a struggle it s also worth it to fight through those feeling and find an even timbre social situation are just approached totally differently from a mental health perspective i ve googled how to feel le lonely and the fucking answer wa make friend how do you make friend when you feel like nobody want to be your friend and for good reason therapist have basically told me to find a group and the friendship will happen naturally but there s not a huge meet up scene in my area and i have a ton of anxiety about going to one and the few i have been to were not great i couldn t read the book on how to influence people and never feel powerless again i got halfway through it and it honestly felt like customer service kiss as bullshit but this time i m not even getting paid for it that book make me feel like i have to scrub my personality clean and poke myself into a small box to be socially acceptable amp x 00b i just don t know i m going to keep trying different thing i m going to keep putting myself out there because the only other choice is to keep doing thing the same shitty way with the same shitty outcome amp x 00b i needed this rant today and if anyone actually manages to read all that thanks

"I was in the shower and started to think if my life realy is as miserable as my mom says. I am 27, a single mom to an 19 month old, currently living with my parents, going through parental court. I take 100 % care of my son.I get up at 6 in the morning, rain or shine, no matter if I have had a panic attack the night before. I tend to my son every needs, I play, I read, I take him on walks and when he goes to bed around 7/8 I go to bed too, and I am asleep by 10.I am currently on sick leave due to PTSD, I stayed home with my son till march, and now I have 6 hours all alone every day except the weekends. I just spend my days,relaxing, napping some days, cleaning and getting back up on my feet. I went through PND/PNA and PPD/PPA (pregnancy/postpartum anxiety+depression), my PTSD went to shits and my eating disorder blossomed again. So its been hard, and since I NEED to put my son first that is what I have done, and now I have the time to put myself first during the daytime. And for me its working.I got no social life, well I talk a bit to the neighbours and parents in kindergarten, but I do not meet up with my friends. I do not date, I just focus on me and my son, and I do not feel lonely or anything just as a bit of a failure at times. Its hard being a mom on my worst days, I do not want to get up from bed but I have to, getting outside to the playground is also hard but I do it.I feel like I am putting in so much hard work, but when my mom talks down on me tells me to cut the crap and my life is miserable, I am starting to think that it might be.From I was 8 and up until now everything has been utter shit, but I am contempt, I am in a good place even though I am struggeling. My PPD has lifted alot and I love my son so so much, and I have been waiting for the whole motherly feeling and now that its here I just want to stay in this bubble. I am working hard to be the mama my son needs, and that means I do not do much social and during the day. But its working for me.Before I had my son I was social,I was out and about, I worked, I was doing 110 % and it made me even more sick.

"Shin indent / wearing socks? Hi all. First off I've seen about 3 doctors through my University and they have all said what I have is 'normal asymmetry'. On my inner, left shin there's this relatively thin 2.5 inch long indent feeling where the muscle/tissue just doesn't seem to be there...or maybe it was damaged. The docs told me that so long as it doesn't impede any daily functioning, hurt extremely bad, grow, or (and this is the biggest one) eventually protrude that I am healthy and in my head. 

I just feel like SOMETHING is there...I've gone to the point where I thought my muscle is deteriorating.

"(Trigger warning) Am I in a mixed episode? I feel like I want to jump out of my own skin, like I want to rip off my limbs. Like everything inside me is wrong - all my bones ache as if they don't fit inside my body, like they want to burst out. Like I want to explode. It's a kind of intense restless agitation to which nothing brings relief. Sometimes I go for a run or bike ride to try calm myself down, but it doesn't have a big effect, and often I end up overexerting myself and get hurt. What appeals to me most in this state is the thought of hurting myself or not living or losing myself in drugs. It's very hard to keep myself from self-harming. I've been in this state for so long and I don't know how much more I can take. In the past I've described it as 'restlessness', because I don't know how else to describe it. But it's clear to me that it's much more than that.

Is this a mixed episode? I've been like this for so long... Sometimes they'll last for one day, sometimes days, sometimes weeks or maybe even months. I'll then have a brief period of respite before returning to the state I've described above. While in this state I can often get into a kind of semi-mania and get things done which I never thought I could - read books, make art, play music, write essays - but always with this horrible exploding depressive restlessness underneath. And it's extremely hard to motivate myself to do anything. But if I curl up in bed or try to calm down with a film or music, my heart begins to pound and shake my entire body, and the restlessness just gets worse and worse and I want to die.

I've tried lots of times to search on the internet for this kind of feeling, but I've never found anything. 
However reading this sub today, I'm struck by how people seem to have had similar sensations. I really didn't think I was Bipolar, because I don't think I have contrasting periods of 'highs' and 'lows'. I might be in a relative 'low', but there will always be the potential for a relative 'high' to emerge quickly out of this low. And vice versa. It's as if everything is there at once, as if I'm in a low and a high at the same time. Always fluctuating, but always wrong. It's awful. It has really impacted all aspects of my life. I've withdrawn from society and do not keep contact with anyone, and when I do meet people they are scared or unnerved by how bizarre my behaviour is.

I know it's unwise to seek opinions on the internet, but at this point in time I have no friends who I can talk to about this, and I don't have the money to see a doctor or psychologist.
If a redditor or two could give their thoughts on my state, it might help point me in the right direction.
Thank you.

"A little bit about me, I am 16 (m), have family and friends who care about me and have actively tried to see it through about helping me with mental health. The problem? I do not use it. I cannot get myself to do it. Everyday I sleep less and less, get angrier and angrier. Recently I have noticed something about myself, as much as I hate the thought of suicide, it still comes back to me. Like to haunt me or just get me to do it. In my closet there is a rope for you know what, and 350$ stuffed away in case I want to just run away. Is that weird? Is it weird that I find comfort in knowing that 6 feet to my left is a way to end it all, or to try and get a fresh start?

"I should say at the outset that I am a survivor of 20 years of suicidal ideation. Please do not accuse me of making light of this subject, I have a right to. (As I believe everyone does, if they do it with love, but that is another story.)My motivations are as follows:1. Expose the ridiculousness that is as inherent in suicide as it is in every action. 2. Replace upsetting brainworms (actual plans) with scenarios which scratch the itch but are also amusing or distracting, or are calming because they are obviously fantasy. I have seen this approach taken, without the above reasoning made explicit, in an old blog I came across once. The only one I can remember is from a standing start, drive your head full-speed at the pavement. It could have been considered a hateful site I guess, but I do not think it came from that place, and I found it hilarious and calming.Please share the most hilarious and fucked up suicide methods that have occurred to you. Ill start with one that recurs to me. I would not wish it on another who never thinks of suicide, but for anyone that does, I hope that it occurs to you in a bad moment, to bring you humour and remind you that you are not alone.So here is my funniest suicide method:Hanging via bungee cord in front of a train. The train hits, and any remains left attached to the stretched rope are comedically pinged back in the opposite direction, disappearing from view near the end of their arc.(I know that this would not work and I know that train drivers deserve better.

"I feel out of place, no matter how much I try I recently signed up for uni, and the first two weeks have been okay, if only I'm only slightly disappointed for not doing more to talk to other people and befriend them.

I still managed to befriend two or three people. I try my best to talk to them, but even just greeting them makes me feel anxious because what if they didn't want to greet me or they didn't want to talk to me or they're talking with someone else clearly closer to them than me or at least more interesting. So I end up feeling out of place because I can't gather the courage to talk more, while they all befriend each other.

Despite all of these feelings, I kept pushing through and this last weekend I managed to ask one of my classmates / friends who I considered myself to be the closest to to hang out, and they accepted. It went well, we talked a lot and in the moment it felt like we were having fun. But when I came back home, all of these awful feelings that maybe they were uncomfortable and didn't really want to hang out with me or talk to me and they were just being polite and nice, or maybe they were just trying to see how it would be like to hangout with me, realizing I'm more of a nuisance and a bore than it's worth to keep around started consuming my mind.

I tried to push these thoughts in the back of my mind as much as I could, but today I already went to class with all of these thoughts filling my mind. I saw my friend (?) enter class, but I couldn't bring myself to talk to them. Not even a single greeting, nothing, and I felt like a piece of shit for not trying more, because surely they thought I was rude for not saying anything. They were talking normally to other people during break time, and I envied all of them. I wish I could talk so easily with other people, befriending them. I wish I wouldn't be scared of saying anything in fears of being ignored. 

So I ended up feeling out of place, again, despite my desires to fit in.

I thought maybe at least we'd have the chance to talk after class. No. All I could manage to mutter was a half-cut word before they said goodbye, even if smiling, and walked up to someone else to talk to them. My logic says everything is okay and today they were simply on a rush after class, but my AvPD says they absolutely hate me and don't want to do anything with me anymore.

I feel like I messed up big time and that I lost a potential friend. I feel like I lost all my chances of having friends ever again, even. And I know it's my fault because I should have talked more, but when I talk more I'm scared to scare them all away. I hate how hard it is to simply say 'hello' and ask someone how they're doing. I feel like I'll be seen as a weirdo and ignored, even if the person is a friend.

So I don't know what to do.

"Here’s my story (LONG) Hey, I’ve been suffering from health anxiety for years now (4-6yrs). I’m 18 now. It all started with me having a tight throat feeling which I have because of GERD (I didn’t know at that time), and I searched it up on google and all my symptoms matched thyroid cancer, etc. I got panic attacks, laying in bed for hours searching on google at age 13.  It became so bad that I never went outside. I used to either tell my friends I’m sick, or just talk to them over the phone to something. 2014 is when I developed my first real disease, called Visual Snow, symptoms are where you are tiny dots over your vision, like pixels. Luckily I’ve managed to ignore that and accepted it as a part of me. 

At age 16 I dropped out of high school because I was unable to wake up in the morning and get ready. Since I dropped out of high school I developed BDD (Body Dysmorphia). It became so bad that I never went out in daylight. I checked the mirrors every 30 minutes, hated my face, etc.  Now I’m 18 and have noticed 4 months ago that my tongue twitches in the mirror (fasciculations). I even read ALS patients never feel their twitches in the tongue. Just like me. At this point, I take it as it is. My life will just be anxiety, diseases, problems etc.",Anxiety

"Struggling with fear of breast cancer after seeing multiple doctors. Feeling lost. Hello everyone! This sub has been a great source of comfort for me for quite some time now. I have never felt the need to post until today as the last month has been very hard on me and I'm hoping someone will have some ideas on how I can combat my extreme health anxiety.

As a preface, I’m a 24 year old woman.

About a month ago, I felt a giant white welt under my left breast. The next day, it was no longer raised completely, but there was a slight bump like a pimple or a bug bite, but there was no 'peak'. It was red in the area, about the size of a quarter. No pain, no itching. I don't think I would have noticed it if I hadn't felt it. I have always struggled with health anxiety but for the past 6 months it has been pretty dormant. Then I googled 'bug bite on breast' and everything spiraled from there.

I stumbled upon Inflammatory Breast Cancer and am now convinced that I have it. I read multiple stories about how it is commonly misdiagnosed as a bug-bite (my doctor said it was a bug bite when I went in). This made my anxiety worse. So I saw another doctor at the family practice I go to. She wasn't sure what it was, it could be a pimple/skin irritation, and told me if it was still there in 2 weeks she would send me to a breast specialist.

I made an appointment with a breast specialist on my own because I could not bear the wait. He looked at it and told me it is most likely just a skin irritation from my bra or a clogged pore that is taking a while to heal. Said if it didn't go away in another 2-3 weeks that he would send me for an ultrasound but he really didn’t think it was anything to worry about.

Again, this was not enough for me. I made an appointment with my OBGYN and he looked at it and echoed the same sentiment the other doctors did. It is nothing, whatever it was is on its way to healing. But he would send me for an ultrasound to set my mind at ease.

I got the ultrasound yesterday and they didn’t find anything. They said there is a chance it was a tiny cyst that is now almost gone that it is undetectable on the machine. This should have made me feel better but I read online that IBC is very hard to detect on ultrasounds. If it didn’t go away in two weeks, the radiologist told me I should see a dermatologist because it seems to be more of a skin issue. 

That day, I called to make an appointment with a derm because I know it takes time to get in to see them. Funnily enough, they had a cancellation that day and asked if I wanted to come in that afternoon. Of course, I said yes. 

When I was there, I explained my issues. The derm looked at it and again, said the same thing everyone else did. It’s most likely just a skin irritation and she gave me the option of waiting to see if it goes away on its own within 2-3 months or she could do a shave biopsy. I, of course, opted for the biopsy.

Then I got home and did more research and found out IBC is usually only diagnosed through a punch biopsy. The biopsy I got at the derm will not be deep enough to diagnose that even if it is there.

I cannot catch my breath and am struggling to function like a normal human being. It’s much more likely that the spot under my breast is just what everyone says it is; an irritation!!! IBC is SO rare, especially for someone my age, but it’s the deadliness of the disease that is haunting my every move. I am so terrified of death and of dying young and leaving behind everyone I love.

I am on 10mg Buspar and have been for only a month now. The side effects are crippling me. I am only sleeping 3-4 hours a night, I’m having horrible nightmares, dizziness, headaches. I am not eating and have lost 15 pounds this month because of it. I cry hysterically almost every night. I obsessively check my boobs, whether that is starting at them in the mirror or prodding them or comparing them (the left one is bigger than the right, always has been – but my health anxiety makes me wonder if it really has always been this way).

Every new spot I discover or mark or freckle sends me into extreme panic. I’m struggling to meet deadlines at work. I’m letting my house go to shit. 


 I just started therapy last week so I am hoping that eventually starts to kick in and help as well.

I guess what I’m looking for is advice on how to calm my nerves. How to function like a normal human being. I’m so depressed. I’m missing out on so much. 

Any words of advice would be so appreciated.

"I think I'm losing my mind Hello guys, long time lurker here. I've seen earlier a post about colon cancer anxiety so I decided to blow off some steam by telling my story.

It all started last summer, when I had a weird pain in my left abdominal area. Went to my GP, said it was nothing but that I should have a blood test (I was 20 at the time). I found out I had an important Calcium deficiency and after I took some supplements the pain disappeared. 

Fast forward to last week: that pain came back, exactly in the same spot. Now I'm going once or sometimes even twice a day, compared to my usual routine of once in two days. The pain fades away after bowel movements and that put me at ease for a couple of days, but today I saw in a stool some dark-brownish spots which I believed to be blood.

"[Rant] I KNEW IT! My medication is poisoning me! I originally posted this over in the /r/CasualConversation Weekly Chat Thread but upon reflection, realized it would be much better suited to this sub as it's pretty specific towards my disorder and I feel I'd get better advice here from people who are knowledgable of what I've been dealing with. 

From my original post:

&gt;It'll be 8 years this summer since I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder and got put on a treatment consisting of Depakote/Epilum (sodium valporate) for rapid cycling moods and mania. Over the years, I've constantly inquired about what sort of side effects I would experience on this drug and every single time, my doctors have been frustratingly vague and flippant, never sitting down and going through the effects in a thorough and detailed manner.
 
&gt;As a result, I've had to do my own research and recently, I uncovered several side effects that NO ONE told me about:

&gt;According to what I've read in numerous articles and medical journals, prolonged/long term usage of sodium valporate can apparently CAUSE depressive episodes and according to the many medical journals I've perused, it is not as effective against treating depressive bipolar episodes in the long run. Considering that I've been dealing with crippling bouts of depression over the last 7 years, this makes sense but no-one told me. NO ONE TOLD ME.

&gt;It can cause pancreatic damage and liver problems on it's own. My pyschiatric doctor (the one who typically prescribes me this shit on a 3 monthly basis) has been constantly drilling it into me that all the times I've gotten elevated liver enzyme readings from my 6-8 weekly blood tests has been because I drank alcohol whilst taking this fucking medication. Not once has she ever stopped to inform me that this stuff causes liver problems all by itself regardless of whether you drink or not, let alone any mention of trouble involving the pancreas, which is typically characterized by intense cramping/pain in the abdomen due to organ damage and inflammation of the pancreas. This makes SO MUCH SENSE considering that all these years I've had near-daily cramping and aches in my abdomen that I always previously thought was due to IBS or my IUD being a dick.

&gt;Apparently, it can increase the likelihood of polycystic ovary syndrome and something called hyperandrogenism which I have never heard of before now but is a condition to do with having too many androgens or male hormones/testosterone in the body along with uterine fibroids which also explains the agonizing cramps I often get regardless of what time of the month it is. Also, I was at child-bearing age (22) when they first started me on sodium valporate and whilst I have no desire to ever procreate, the fact of the matter is that all these conditions lead to infertility so I feel incredibly deceived by the doctors who put me on this shit because again, NO-ONE TOLD ME ANY OF THIS.

&gt;I am absolutely steaming and yet I just know that if/when I raise these issues with my current psych doctor, she will no doubt laugh off my concerns like she always fucking does and dismiss my worries as trivial.

&gt;I know it's dangerous to quit cold turkey but I honestly feel so betrayed right now considering all that I've learned. I ended up writing a strongly worded but teeth-grittingly ""polite"" letter outlining all these concerns so I can slap her in the face with it- not literally but y'know- and get my voice heard.

&gt;I want to change my doctor and try to get one who will help me find an alternative course of treatment but giving that all this happened on public healthcare (which is often laughably crap at times here), it wouldn't surprise me if it ends up being a long drawn out process.

&gt;Urgh. I'm so angry I could spit fire!",Bipolar

But this past January I:

-thought I was an Aztec chased by jaguars and loved the feeling of fighting for my life. It was exhilarating. 

-thought the Starbucks mermaid lady was laughing at me and that walls were moving. Also heard some voices.

-walked through puddles in the rain and got my clothes and shoes sopping wet because I thought I’d be reincarnated as a mentally healthy person

-saw cameras where there were none 

-thought people on the bus were plotting to kill me 

-thought an escalator was gonna eat me

-kept dissociating 

-pretended to eat my fingers like they were chicken tenders, looked in the mirror and thought my mouth was full with my fingers and laughed at myself, then I was horrified.

-in my head was thinking “I must grab the skin and scooped it out” and realized I was picking at my face and stopped myself 

-overall I was unstable for around 2 weeks

-was incredibly depressed for around a month afterwards

"Worried about my gap year I am a college senior and lately I have been stressed to the point that it has been affecting my sleep schedule. Currently I am taking a gap year to retake some prerequisites and study for the MCAT med school, I don’t live at home due to my school being far away, but I am stress that I have to be at home and study for it. I didn’t have my own room before I left to college. I had to lose one of the unused rooms in my house as my personal room, unfortunately, my parents decided that they prefer this room compared to the master bedroom.

"A story going from manic to depressive Bipolar II explained 

My eyes open. WHAT A GOOD DAY TO BE ALIVE. Why was I so down yesterday? Maybe I should go to the gym. No, no: maybe I should get some work done. Yes work, I’ve been neglecting work. Actually maybe I should pay rent, I’m a couple of days overdue. I put on my favourite song. What a great fucking song, my auditory cortex shoots out musical notes like buckets of cum for my vagina of a cerebral cortex to process and enjoy. 
   
First I need to make breakfast. What’s the most optimal amount of nutrients I can make in a meal for my body weight? I research this for a couple of hours; I want to know anything and everything about how nutrients work from the macro to the micro level. I order an organic chemistry book. I order a vegetable juicer. I order 5 different multivitamins and 2 fish oils. I go for a run, planning my ultimate breakfast. I am so excited. I get a few hours of work done, life is so fucking great. Hell, maybe I’ll even find a girlfriend soon. 

Maybe I can share this with my friends. I haven’t spoken to them in a while, but I think it would be really great to catch up. So I plan 3 coffee dates for tomorrow. Perfect, that will scratch my social itch. I also want to get REALLY fucking high. Or maybe I’m just craving affection. Peaking on MDMA and having my first kiss felt identical. So does the mdma comedown and breaking up. I don’t deal with relationships very well. I’m either careless or obsessive. Very rarely do I find a good fit, in fact I haven’t yet. But I’ve learned from my mistakes.

My thoughts start racing. Maybe I’ll never find someone to give this boundless love to. Maybe I’m not attractive enough. Maybe I’m too weird. Who spends 4 hours planning their breakfast? Sometimes I say things I don’t mean. Sometimes I just want people to like me. Sometimes I won’t shut up. Sometimes friends say they like me or click well with me but it doesn’t feel genuine. Are all my relationships fake? I’m definitely overthinking this. This can’t be true.

 My dad comes into my room and asks how applying to work is going, I tell him to fuck off. I can’t believe I just said that. I’m just mentally fucked up and waiting for my meds to work, this must be the case. My friends like me, right? I need to slow down my thoughts, this is driving me mad. I order some ket, haven’t eaten all day and decide to order pizza. I binge and fall asleep. 

I wake up. The greyness of the bleak sky reflects through my cold window. I gather all my strength to go take a shower. I made it to the bathroom and undress. I’ve put on weight. My brutal acne medicine isn’t working as promised, in fact it’s made it worse. I’ve ignored calls from my landlord for days now, there’s no way I can call him and sort it out. I dropped out of school, I’m a fucking failure. I put on my favourite song. My auditory cortex hits me cerebral cortex with notes like harpoons to Moby Dick. What trash, how can anybody enjoy music?

Oh fuck, I have to meet up with my friends today. I try and get myself together and make a lazy breakfast. One friend calls me and says he can’t make it. I’m somewhat upset but also relieved. I meet up with my other friend. We have a seemingly normal conversation but I am fucking shattered. I can’t tell if he can tell or not. I leave the conversation feeling defeated, I’ve had so much to say and nothing but small talk left my mouth. He must think I’m boring, I despise being boring. 

I return home to find my books, vitamins and juicer waiting for me in a parcel at my doorstep. I’m never gonna use this shit, what’s the point? Ah but yes, my ket arrived, I’ll get a couple of hours of peace completely zombified. 

My dad calls me when I’m all fucked up. He can tell I’m fucked up and he’s worried I’m going to overdose. I try to pretend to be sober and he tries to pretend to believe that I’m sober as to not upset me more, it’s the saddest thing in the world. He drives me to the emergency unit and I get my vitals checked, all is seemingly fine. My parents have been nothing but supportive and I’m still like this. My phone dies and I can’t get it to work, my last friend completely ghosted and in my mind gone forever. Maybe some day I’ll get better, I’m just waiting for the meds to work. I fall asleep.

I wake up, WHAT A GOOD DAY TO BE ALIVE.

"I told myself that 2019 was going to be the year I beat this; two days in I’ve failed I discovered a small spot on my abdomen to the right of my belly button that is a little bit sore when I bend over or move a certain way. I’ve poked and prodded at it so much trying to feel around for any abnormalities such as a lump, that now it hurts more from all the poking. I’m not exactly sure what it is that I’m afraid I have this time since I’m trying so hard not to google anything and besides appendicitis, I am not sure what other malicious causes could explain this sort of abdominal pain.

"Experiences with Lithium? My doctor prescribed me lithium 300mg ER twice a day. I have been extremely reluctant to start the medicine because of the dumbest reason ever, the notorious weight gain. 
I take care of myself pretty well with the exception of a few beers every other weekend or so (definitely nowhere near drunk). I go to the gym 4-5 days a week and eat relatively healthy. I just recently lost a few pounds, and am still trying to lose more (personal preference, I'm a healthy weight). I drink probably around 10 glasses of water a day. Does anyone have experience with weight gain on the med?

"Relationship I started a relationship 6 months ago with a great guy, both of us are in our early 20s and were friends for a while before starting the relationship. He's kind, open-minded, respectful, communicative, I have no complains about him. That being said, since last year (mid 2022) I've had multiple problems related to my family and my mental health has gotten even worse. I have no friends and my only company is him and I dont think is healthy for him to be with someone like me: I self-isolate (been doing that since I was a girl), don't have much time for him (studies+work+family+mental health), my family doesn't support my relationships and they're capable of harming those I love (they're abusive but I have no possibility of leaving home, especially in my country). 

I barely have the energy to wake up in the morning and have spend the last years by myself without friends or a partner because of that. I'm diagnosed with depression, AvPD and eating disorders and have gone to therapy (with different psychologists who had different approaches) for +10 years and I have took different med combinations with no success. Currently I'm not in therapy and with no medication, but I'm saving money to start again in March.

What should I do? I like him and I love him but I don't even have the energy to answer his messages, let alone dates and be a proper partner who listens to him, helps him, spends time with him, etc. I have told him all of this and he still wants to be with me, but I feel the relationship would end up being one-sided and I don't want that for him. 

I'm deeply ashamed of myself. Since day 1 I've cried every day and night because of that and because of the ridiculous amounts of energy I need to do anything, especially things that have to do with the relationship. I've tried to change and get better, I've spent so much money on therapy and meds with no results, I've read dozens of self-help and psychology books and hundreds of papers, I've tried to change my habits (diet, sleep more, etc), but I just dont know how to get better.

"Struggling with new medication, and shame. I was diagnosed with bipolar ii three years ago. This is the first time I've been on mood stabilizers. I had a lot of shame when I was diagnosed, and they started me on anti-depressants. After awhile, I stopped taking them. Stopped going to my CBT appointments. Essentially went MIA because I felt like everyone around me was treating me like I was crazy.

My highs and lows have been out of control lately. After struggling with self harm when I was depressed, and nearly quitting my job and deciding to move to another state (I didn't.) I decided I needed some help.

So, now I'm on 300mg of seroquel. I just started it so I need to give it some time, but every fiber of my being says 'flush them.' I feel like I zombie, and I'm wondering if maybe I can just learn to cope instead of being on medication. I smoke weed sometimes to help curb my anxiety, and help me sleep. Sleep isn't an issue now. 

I know there is a good chance I'll gain weight, and I'm already pretty overweight so that idea alone makes me feel really shitty. 
I'm ashamed to be on medication again, so nobody in my family knows. Just this thread, and one friend, now...

"An absence of social pleasure (social anhedonia) It is not possible to know what it is like to experience the world from inside someone else’s body, but I can infer from others that people enjoy being with other people more than I do. 

It is rare that I enjoy a person’s company. Usually I look forward to being alone again. Instead of pleasure, I do feel an absence of loneliness or fear, but these are not pleasure. I very much experience health benefits from being with other people, I can’t deny this, but in the moment I feel like something important is missing. 

To say it different, I don’t feel a desire to be with others unless I am wanting to soothe or avoid loneliness or fear. By default, being alone is peaceful and ideal. 


Is it really anhedonia, or is it also possible that my default is actually that the social anxiety overpowers the social pleasure so that I can’t feel feel. And it takes a really strong negative emotion to overpower social anxiety in order to provoke a desire to be with others.

+ Cardiac arrythmias (thousands a day)
+ Various skin complaints
+ Alopecia Barbae (beard patches)

I’ve now had 9 months of all these symptoms and I’ve tried individual meds like beta blockers, PPI, tweaking diet, exercise with no luck… the docs say this is all because of going through  a major life disruption and it’s due to underlying stress.

"Coming off of Lamactil, which was honestly lovely save for some severe (but not SJS) skin reactions... I'm in hell, and Pdoc wants me to start Seroquel but I don't wanna. Bleh.

I was on 200mg of Lamactil for 4 months. I had some of my very best days ever in those 4 months, emotionally speaking, but I had some ugly blisters, and a mouth full of ulcers, that I/we eventually decided were due to a reaction to Lamactil.

SO i've been doing a fast taper, 50% lower a week, I'll be done with the taper next weekend...

This morning had an emergency appointment witht the pdoc because the depression lows were getting worse than they had been since before starting Lamactil...

So, she wants me on a fast taper up to 300mg of Seroquel. The side effects terrify me, I'm already obese, being lethargic and gaining wait, along with all the other pretty common side effects...

I mean I know I'll probably feel better, maybe, but at a cost I'm not entirely sure I can bare.

My other option is to use copious amounts of marijuana, which she is like, 50/50 on. She wasn't into marijuana before we had a legal program, and now she's relenting a bit...

Since then, I've gotten on SSRIs and have improved a lot, but my girlfriend has to leave for another week soon. I think I'll be okay, but I'm still a little worried that my anxiety is going to come back in full force. When she's home, I have the comfort of knowing that she could take me to the hospital if anything awful happens, but I feel very vulnerable when it's just me, especially at night. I don't have any family or close friends around here, so I can't depend on that either.

Does anybody have any tips for how to feel more safe when you're on your own? Thanks in advance.",Anxiety
"I am really, truly screwed this time My parents have decided to stop paying for my food, in the middle of a catatonic depression. I’m scared for myself. I woke up today finally having had enough with starving. I was on my way to the store, for the first time in a month (I’ve only been running low about a week tho), when I got this text from my dad: 

“Do not spend any money at all this week.  Rent is coming out and there is ONLY enough in there for the payment. Unfortunately, you have gone through the remainder of the ‘borrowed money’ from the loans I took out. And you didn’t get a rent discount this year because you filled out the renewal too late. You will have to ask for permission before any new expenses for us to move money into the account.”

I’m backed so far into a corner. I am just defeated. I have no food left, I have no money, and I can’t bear the judgement. It feels like I’ve already lost everything, now they’ve even taken *my food?* I can’t do anything about it in this mental state. They don’t even know I’ve already failed out of my semester and can’t leave my apartment. And my parents are insane. Legitimately delusional and abusive human beings. I mean I’m crazy, but these folks? Who starves their mentally ill son because ‘there’s not enough money’ and then flies to Vegas for the weekend for a vacation? I hate myself but even I don’t deserve this. 

The isolation, judgement, and control I live under is unimaginable. There’s nothing metaphorical about it, it is torture.

"My future feels so hopeless. I'm 28 years old, my resume is useless, haven't worked in 2 years, and I am very avoidant of the world Hi there. I have been depressed since I was 12 years old. I am now 28. I also struggle with BPD, social anxiety and Avoidant Personality Disorder, afraid to leave the house by myself, reliant on my 66 year old mother to pay my medical insurance, and my husband is working full time barely keeping us afloat. I have tried and tried to work. Several different fields. Even part time. It always ended up in burn out and felt more depressed and anxious so I had to quit. I am worried, I feel my future is really hopeless. I love my husband so much. We wanted to have a family and it's feeling like that won't happen because of my mental health and the low money thing. I am afraid he will abandon me because of all this though deep down really don't feel like he will because he has been here through everything.

I know that is so much. That is definitely something to be grateful for. But we fight a good bit because we're both so stressed out.

Nothing really brings me happiness except substances, (and that leads to bad feelings when it wears off or sometimes when on them) and I've been mostly sober for a year.

I see a therapist. I take medications. I just... I am not content in life. I am constantly worried about everything. I constantly feel like I'm worthless and my husband deserves someone more stable that he doesn't essentially have to be a caregiver to at times. I stay in bed about 70% of my days because I feel like things are so hard to do and feel so pointless.

I don't have many friends and live in a small town, so there aren't any meetup groups or anything. And since I don't work and am not in school, no opportunities to make many friends. I do have one so I can try to branch out with her friends maybe. It feels like life is just about working. And I feel so depressed by the state of everything, and by my worries that things won't improve in the future.

Things don't get better. Not if you don't work for them. And I have worked, I've tried so many treatments, but the one thing I rarely do is go out in the world.

"I was triggered while talking to an old school friend and crashed the interaction This happened 9 month ago.

I (M,50) was being approached by a woman that was in the same class in school with me some 30+ years ago. 

I was just loading groceries into my car when she drove past behind me and said loudly: ""oh hey, that's a familiar face... :-)"". 

I turned around and was pleasantly surprised to see her... we started to talk, she said she has seen me in this supermarket before. 

We exchanged some small talk... what do you do, where do you live, do you still have contact with the people of the past... this kind of stuff. 

I already was kind of nervous, because of the small talk situation, but when the topic of the other people from the past came up, i began to panic. 

The thing is, that i was being bullied for the 5 years that I was in this class. Not from her, she was always nice.

But the time in this class left it's marks and I didn't want to have anything to do with the people from these circles after I was done there.

So at the end of our talk she asked if we should exchange numbers... and i froze. 

There were just so many thoughts in my head, but i couldn't say any of them because none of these were appropriate for a casual conversation after 30 years.

A small part of me was flattered that she remembered me and cared to approach me.

But all the other parts of my brain were actively persuading me why this was not a good idea:

""when i exchange numbers i will have to be prepared for her to call/text anytime, i don't like this.""

""i clearly still have a problem with the ""old times"" and the people from the past.""

""when i call/text with her then i will have to explain this sooner or later or just lie and pretend that these things did not affect me.""

""this is not the kind of topic that i can casually bring up after 30 years, so i can't explain this, and don't think that i can lie, either...""

""besides, if i exchange numbers then i will have to, well, talk... text... ask questions... like a normal person, and since i live very isolated, i kind of forgot how to do this.""

""and what do i do if she wants to get a coffee... or meet others..."" 

""it's better to just end this here now and not exchange numbers.""

""but i can't say that i don't want to exchange numbers, who does something like this? i would have to explain this.""

I was spiraling...

I'm not sure how long i stood there saying nothing. I guess she could tell from my face that there was a problem.

Then she said: ""you don't have to say anything"".

I think I mumbled something like ""okay"", and ""it was really nice meeting you"" and we parted.

I should have just exchanged the number and go from there.

I really would have liked to be able to do this, but i couldn't.

I regret this now, and i am constantly thinking if i should contact her (I know her address but of course not her phone number, so i would have to write a letter i guess) and try to explain things.

At least tell her that it \*really\* was nice seeing her and that my reaction (or lack thereof), was not because of her, but had other personal reasons.

"Longtime lurker with AvPD just wanting to vent about the fantasy of disappearing and starting a different life Using my alt throwaway because reasons. Recently I’ve been having a hard time, and although I have deeply caring and wonderful people in my life, I still isolate and as much as I crave time with others I get tired so easily after a short while. Also grew up with cluster B parents and family which doomed me to some kind of mental problems. 

Lately I’ve begun to think about the idea of just leaving. Disappearing, no trace. Not suicide. I’m not suicidal at all, I mean leaving, going somewhere I’m not known, changing all my details, and completely starting over. I can’t help but feel it would make no difference to anyone, in fact it might even be better.

I’ve googled step by step ‘how to’s ’ on it.

I’m hoping to be able to talk to others who have been in this dark of a place and what got you through - or any advice.

Because this is mostly just a fantasy, but the idea is sticking in my head more than I’d like it to. I don’t actually want to go through with it. I think …

"Throat/Chest Palpatations, Left Eye twitch and weakness almost everywhere So I had been doing great with my health anxiety for nearly a year.

"I firmly believe undiagnosed ADHD is a big part of the reason why I have this disorder Beyond emotional (and sometimes physical) neglect, I always knew something was different about me. And not in a good way. I couldn't relate to my peers growing up and I could never figure out why. I was always ""too much"". Too loud, too weird, too emotional. I never had the same interests as the other kids around me. Which made me sad because I wanted to, but never did 

Then there's the fact that I couldn't catch on to jokes quickly, which made me awkward. My poor attention span and memory made things worse. Sometimes my teacher would ask me to do a favor (like grab something from a shelf) and I couldn't follow directions. This happened a lot growing up. People getting frustrated with me or thinking there's something wrong with me because I couldn't follow directions. 

This evolved into a massive fear of being embarrassed. If someone was telling me where to go, I'd need a visual. A map or for me to write down their directions, because I'll get lost. My short term memory is so bad. I remember my uncle was giving me his phone number (we were moving and he had to leave and come back but I needed to be in contact with him). 

He recited the numbers and I couldn't remember what he said quick enough. I just always felt like I'm slow to process things. I still am. Someone will state a fact about themselves, I'll look them in the face and nod like I was listening. But I wasn't, so I *repeat what they said back to them* and they all give me this ""wtf"" look and they tell me they just said that a moment ago. 

Sometimes I forget the things I myself said and it would lead to me repeating myself multiple times. Again, ending with people giving me this ""wtf is wrong with her?"" Look. Yikes. 

It doesn't help that I think I deal with rejection sensitive dysphoria. It takes *very little* for me to get flustered and embarrassed. It led to me lashing out at others as a child, which ofc led to me being excluded eventually. I always over-expressed my emotions and I think that was off putting to other people. When I was happy I was very happy. When I felt a twinge of sadness, I was crying, when I was mad I was yelling and name calling.

I had overall weird impulsive behavior. I would say the most random things and make really weird movements (I still do but only at home lol). I think all of these things just made others reject me because I was so strange. And to avoid the harsh judgement, I started masking all of my ""quirks"", but I lost myself in the process. 

I went from one extreme to the other. Instead of being overly expressive, I isolate myself and I come off as cold, uncaring, and stuck up. But this couldn't be further from the truth. I truly *do* care about people but I'm emotionally blocked off and still trying to mask those symptoms that make me seem ""weird""

Ever since I was a child, a pattern has been that I am verbally offered support and love, but when it matters and when I reach out for it, it would be rescinded.

"Positive experiences with mood stabilizer? Hi everyone. 
So, I had an issue on Friday evening. I had what my husband thought was a seizure but the emergency room physician said was a dystonic reaction likely to my medication (seroquel 100mg) which I’ve been on for about two years at varying doses. 
Aside from that I’ve been having odd neurological symptoms for about the same amount of time that I’m having investigated by a neurologist currently. 
So, I’m seeing a new psychiatrist and at the request of the treating doctor Friday they have come to the decision to taper me off of seroquel, and add a mood stabilizer. I’ve never tried a mood stabilizer. This is the plan so far. She also affirmed my bipolar diagnosis made by the last psychiatrist I saw and also suspects I suffer from PMDD. But, that’s another story. 

Week 1
50mg of seroquel nightly 
450mg of depakote 

Week 2
25mg of seroquel nightly 
900mg of depakote 

Week 3
Stop seroquel 
(Start 1/2 tablet of trazodone for sleep as needed)

Just wanted to hear positive experiences with depakote. I’m trying to go into this win a positive attitude instead of being fearful.  ",Bipolar
"Lower back, butt and leg pain due to stress? Has anyone else felt constant back &amp; leg pain (or even general muscle pain on any part of the body due to stress? 

I have never had back problems, ever. Knock on wood, I’ve had no accidents, no sciatic issues, no joint issues, pinched nerve issues or broken bones etc.

That being said, I’ve been undergoing a lot of stress lately. The pain has been building up for a few days but tonight, I’m experiencing increased pain! Feels like the origin is the right side of my lower back and the pain radiates down through my butt cheek into my calf (pain is not travelling to foot). It‘s not a sharp pain. It’s more of a gnawing, dull but steady pain. Feels as if I’ve been punched HARD several times in the said area and I only get a bit of relief if I curl up in my side in the fetal position. 

I found literature online saying that stress can cause these symptoms but I just find it so bizarre. Am I really that fragile thay stress could cause so much havoc? I’m in my 30s. No major health issues. I did have mild covid 1.5 weeks ago though. The only other thing I can think of is the fact that I’ve been sitting a lot due to studying for exams nonstop.

"I don’t have an appointment until Thursday and I am barely hanging on... horrible mixed episode... not sure what to do in this situation It started with a massive depressive episode after over a month of doing really good. It came out of nowhere with none of the usual triggers or red flags. It got to they point where I was about to go to the ER. The only thing that stopped me is that I work at the hospital and I would have been seen by people I know. 

I made it through the night. Since then I have had a few days of being almost constantly awake, in various states of mania and hopelessness. My therapist can’t see me until Thursday and my Psych doc can’t see me until next Tuesday. My antipsychotic was gone, I had been doing so good that I hadn’t used it in forever.

"Went on 2mg Abilify exactly 7 days ago as of today. I've gained 7 pounds. I am a 32 year old woman who was RX'd Abilify 2mg last week and began taking it a week ago today. I take it with 30mg lexapro, which i've taken for several years with no weight gain at all.

I am naturally very thin and always have been under weight. I have 
never had to worry about my weight...until now being on an AAP. I don't even own a scale and borrowed my roommate's today to find out my weight today and last week. The day I began the meds, 7 days ago, I was 117lbs, and am now 124.5. I am still within the healthy benchmark for my height at 5'6. 

However, given that it's only been a week and its 7 pounds, that's a lot, isn't it? I am excited to be a bit curvier and filled out, but I worry about how unhealthy this rapid increase could be, as diabetes runs in my family and I worry this medication will affect my health and metabolism negatively.

This now is the ultimate incentive to exercise (as i was infrequent) and eat few calories/carbs than before. I used to be someone who could eat anything and be rail thin. 

I'm hoping the effects of Abilify will out weigh the bad. I found that on day 5 of taking it, which was this Monday, was the first day I really felt like it was beginning to make me feel better. So far, I find myself in a happier mood and my coworkers today told me I seem happier and asked me if something good or different happened. I didn't have an answer! I am now not scowling or irritable like I was. I am able to smile at people in my building now at work, when I wasn't able to before.

"Depressive episodes are not forever One thing that gets me through my episodes is the knowledge that it can't last forever. For several years before I was diagnosed I only really experienced depression (no hypomania at all) and it felt like it would never end. And I know that a fair amount of people also feel this way. And some people suffer from chronic depression. But now with my diagnosis I feel that as long as my episode lasts and however intense it is it can't last forever. 

I guess it's just a small solace. But on the flip side, when I was just depressed I held on to hope that one day I would be cured but with bipolar that hope is pretty much squashed. So I guess it's a mixed bag.",Bipolar

"Something I wrote before I knew I was bipolar. I used to think it was a personality disorder, instead of a mood disorder.   

Dear Journal…well I really don’t know that much about you being dear… that’s clearly a lie as it is the first time I write in this type of journal -though I had been writing quite often on “my phone journal”-. Either way, dear beloved, and most precious electronic journal, I will bless thee with the presence of worded words that word the words I word. Today’s riveting topic…. My day! As I don’t think I have the mental capacity to write about anything else of meaning… or do I? The purpose of this journal thing is to make me a better writer in both English and Spanish, yet if all I put into the white walls is rubbish and nonsense, how am I to become better at throwing electronic ink at immaterial wood-stuff? Perhaps I should find something… as simple as it may be…something I can turn into cohesion. I guess it is as good a time as ever to speak about feelings… my feelings, nonetheless.

How does anxiety feel? I know we’ve all been there. Any E-scripture on anxiety that you might stumble upon will say as much, but, baring mental health professionals, I don’t think that those of us that enunciate the word “anxiety” with statistical-outlier levels of frequency have the same notion of the concept than those whose usage falls into the mean. What I mean by that, of course, is that those of us afflicted by pathological levels of anxiety feel it in a quantitively and qualitatively different way. I guess that’s why we get diagnosed… catalogued as distinct by the authorities that oversee defining this part of society. We’re a messy bunch. It reflects in all facets of my life.

I have messy hair, messy eyes, my room is messy my thoughts are scattered (and messy!), I can’t make a decision for the love of myself; the short version: I don’t work. I mean that both literally and figuratively, whatever that means! (think about it! What does the verb “to work” mean in a literal way? Is it having a job? But that’s having a job, we call it work because you do motions in a job, but we call the motions “work”, because “work” is the act of physical exertion right? I don’t know, this is literal garbage that I’m talking right now (talking/writing “garbage” can’t literally be literal (I think I just transferred a calque from Spanish, too long to get into this tangent))). I can’t hold a normal job; I can’t hold my emotions most of the times. Today some guy at the mall forgot my coffee, and I felt like as if I’ve murdered someone. I mean, I’ve never killed anyone -and I hope I never do such a heinous thing-, but you know that feeling you get in your chin, your chest and neck that pushes you down? The one you get when something bad, really bad is about to happen? I was feeling that over a coffee man. I stared the guy directly in the eye, not with the best of intentions. I was literally offended, but I don’t feel that it was in a normal way. How do I know that? Cause I didn’t use to be like that. Emotions, to me, seem to work now like to a BPD patient (perhaps I have BPD traits?). How do emotions work for BPD patients? Simple! Take an emotion X and then square it. A more detailed example: anger(in BPD afflicted individual) = anger\^2. Or perhaps it’s even a cubical function: i.e., anger\^3 (I don’t even remember if cube is exponential 3). Anxiety is writing parenthesis excusing yourself of mistakes in your personal journal entries that no one else will ever fucking read.

Anxiety is looking at your neighbor and running away inside your home for no reason. Anxiety is feeling gutted for dreaming about the people that made you the happiest you’ve been in ages. Anxiety is snapping at those who love you, because you can’t love yourself and everything has a bitter taste to shit. Anxiety is wanting to die, looking at places where you could hang yourself, feeling relief at the thought of no longer breathing, imagining a knife to the throat, thinking about swerving into traffic, travelling, and not feeling anything, kissing someone you’re deeply into and not feeling anything, doubting everything you do, every single cell in your body being inadequate. Anxiety is knowing at a scientific level that something is wrong, but still suffering through it. Anxiety is abusing drugs, anxiety is depression, anxiety is the antithesis of life, of enjoyment, of love and all that’s good. This is “anxiety”, as this is obviously a corrupted, poisonous version of a feeling that’s supposed to help us survive: i.e., anxiety. “Anxiety” turns a survival tool against those who are trying to survive.

"I took public transit today. After not being able to step foot out of the house without my ex driving me, I finally was able to step up and go on public transit by myself. 

It’s been 2 years since I’ve taken the bus. I honestly did not know what I was doing- but I asked the drivers for help and directions as to which bus to get on next etc etc… 

Social anxiety was at an all time high and still is, writing this on the way home. So many people are on this bus and the only thing I’m thinking about is “when do I get home” and “why are they looking at me”. 

Realistically they’re looking at me because people have eyes and observe what’s in front of them, and scolding myself that they don’t have hidden agendas is helping lol.

I’m reading a lot about this, mainly to understand the guy I’m dating better who has AVPD!

Is there specific content that triggers you to avoid replying I.e expression of feelings?  Yet I hear that the AVPD community does enjoy getting reassurance.

"Why do I feel weak and sick all the time? Freaking out for a month now. Bloodwork/uralysis results: https://imgur.com/a/divyBwV

**Please click on the images and expand them before claiming they are too blurry to read.  Thank you.**

Bilirubin was elevated, but he said it was just Gilbert's syndrome?  He is my new family doctor (Canada).  Old family doctor would have done all sorts of clinical examination (feeling abdomen for things, listening to abdomen with stethoscope, neurological testing etc.), but new doctor barely looks at me.

Daily fatigue began last March, improved somewhat in September, then worsened again in January.  I've been experiencing the following symptoms for the past month+:

* Muscle weakness - hands and legs feel shaky and uncoordinated, worried I'm going to drop glasses when I pick them up to drink, legs shake while I'm walking up and down stairs, etc.  Worsens with exertion.
* Left hand feels weaker than right, and sometimes has pins and needles sensation.
* Extreme drowsiness
* Brain fog
* Flushing in legs, chest, head, and what feels like rapid temperature fluctuations from cold to warm.
* Lower left abdominal pain and discomfort.
* Nausea and dizziness
* Feel very hungry much of the time, often shortly after eating.  Gnawing feeling of hunger.
* Seem to never gain weight despite eating 4 meals a day.
* Mild urine retention due to tight bladder neck (began 2+ years ago, diagnosed via cystoscopy in November)
* Infrequent sharp pain near anus/rectum
* Very twitchy eyelids - Initially it was only my right eyelid, but now my left eyelid twitches as well as eyebrow and upper cheek on right side.

Stool is mostly normal, but:

* Undigested bits of food in stool
* Feel like bowels aren't completely voided, but can't push the rest out.  Feeling goes away after wiping.
* Stool sometimes broken up into large chunks instead of one long stool
* Stool sometimes thin and stringy

Symptoms can be up and down, but mostly down, and seem to correlate with food on some level, although I can't figure out any meaningful pattern.  I am unsure which symptoms are connected and which are not.  The fatigue and weakness worsens with exertion, even just going for walks, making exercise difficult.  

I am a 30 year old male.  I weigh 120-125lbs, and height is 5""6.  I haven't had alcohol in over 4 years, and I've never been a heavy drinker.  I eat reasonably healthy meals, and still maintain a reasonably high appetite in spite of these symptoms.

Most distressing symptom by far is the fatigue and weakness.  Can barely keep eyes open sometimes, and it can feel like I'm tied to a ball and chain.

I had an ultrasound and liver workup, in addition to the bloodwork above, which were apparently normal.

Doctor believes I have somatic issues related to anxiety and refuses to do additional testing or refer me to any specialist.  I cannot find a new doctor, because there is an extremely long waiting list for family doctors.  While I begged him for more investigation he practically sat there laughing at me and told me to go find another doctor if I wasn't happy.

I am worried, and my quality of life is suffering.  Should I just keep going to the hospital until they agree to investigate?  What should I do?",Anxiety

"snippets about me that maybe y'all can relate to This is an incomplete list of course, but I've taken ages to build up the motivation to post SOMETHING here, this is what I got for now. I'm hoping anyone reading this would please add to the conversation their own similar experiences or attributes, or would please ask me to expand on any point I have listed.
--------------------

	1. I need to consume multiple forms of media on multiple devices in order to be content. I divide my attention towards trivial topics.

	2. I have detailed dialogue in my head that I desperately wish I could record, but whenever I try it's not detailed, I get tired of it, and it ends up unfinished. I have countless unfinished drafts and scattered files that I take endless time to organize, only to still not post what I initially wanted to.

	3. I take hours to get myself ready to go out (typically to my local dive bar). I know I'll enjoy myself when I get there and I know a lot of familiar friends and faces there. But once it's time to leave I psych myself out over going; my primary concern is that I don't look as nice as I usually do, or I'll get a detached, disassociated feeling once I get there. Many nights I end up going to bed with my outfit and makeup freshly done and still on, never have left my place.

	4. The red notification circle showing me the amount of unread text and unanswered calls I have is so large that it breaks me out to open the damn thing at all. I end up ghosting relationships that I didn't want to abandon. The guilt of how long it's been when they last sent a message to present day keeps me from responding. If I have to make plans with someone, I have to actively not look at the other unread messages below it or else I'll have an internal panic.

	5. I'm self-isolated and alone and lonely more than I ever have to be and I fucking know this. I highly value people and relationships, despite how my avoiding nature implies otherwise.

	6. My childhood consists of consistent moving for rarely to none disclosed reasons. My mom is an aggressive woman who's genuinely diagnosed with bipolar disorder and it's difficult to communicate with her. Growing up, I never lived in a location even close to 2 years. I think this has fucked me up in many ways.

	7. I am a very vivid and active dreamer. I speak frequently in my sleep- sometimes I wake myself up for my own talking. 4 years I had chronic nightmares and was a bedwetter; the nightmares and accidents were most frequent after every move. This subsided by age 24, when I was done with University and moving as frequently.

	8. I've used meth for nearly 8 years; via smoking and snorting, never injections. It's never made me feel horny like it does most people. I compare the sensation to taking 'dirty Adderall'; meaning I have a zombified, obsessive focus on whatever task. I'm either indulging in rabbit holes or addictively playing chess on my phone. More broad and accurate to say is that I productively procrastinate; my place will get so clean or I fulfill minuscule to-do task, but I continue to avoid my most pressing and urgent needs. 

	9. Actual Adderall feels like medicine to me. Like the focus increase isn't jarring, but natural. There's no crash and no tweaked out feeling. I feel like what I believe I'm supposed to feel like, as a content and motivated individual. ",Personality disorder

"I systematically throw up before having a Zoom meeting with my soon-to-be PHD supervisor Before anyone asks, no, the problem is not coming from my supervisor. He’s kind, willing to help and available for me. 

If you ask me I wouldn’t even say that I feel stressed before the meetings, in the sense that I’m not overthinking, I’m not having this bowl of stress in my belly that one could have facing pressure. 

Yet I don’t know why, systematically, 10-5 minutes before the meeting, I go to the toilet and I throw up everything I have, even if I had a light breakfast before. I really don’t know what can I do to stop this because it doesn’t feel like the problem is coming from me. It feels like I have no other choice but to throw up. 

Obviously it’s linked to the fact that I’m going to apply to a PhD and the fact that he’s a very knowledgeable man in his field, and there’s probably a bit of impostor syndrome playing. But what’s worrying me is the fact that of all the 10-12 meetings we had so far, I systematically throw up. I’ve had other meetings with other supervisors when I was a research assistant for instance and it didn’t happen probably because the stakes are lower. What can I do to feel better ?",Stress

"Stopped lamictal and noticed how it was affecting me I've been off of lamictal for a week now after developing mild rash symptoms.

Since being off, I'm less irritable, more social, and more creative/funny.

The downside is that my sleep schedule is now shit and that my swings are back to what they used to be (which isn't all that bad since my depressive swings have always been mild/moderate - it's the hypomania thats the slightly problematic one but I'm aware of when it's setting in).

Don't really know how to proceed really because the trade offs don't really seem worth it for me. I Uber so I can drive when I want and the hypomanic impulsivity isn't really something I think I can't handle.

"This is a bit of a weird question, but does anyone else relate a lot to these anime titles? (Mushishi, Kino's Journey etc) I've always wondered if this is something AvPD adjacent.

* Mushishi

* Kino's Journey

* Spice and wolf

* Girl's last tour

* Serial Experiments Lain

They are not really related in any genre way but all feature some sort of disconnect with the MCs and the rest of the world. It's like you're just traveling through it and never really putting down roots but instead just observing for a while and then moving on, they all sort of have this somber undertone that you're not really a part of the world and just experiencing small parts of it. 

Most of them feature a pair traveling together which makes it feel less lonely but Mushishi only has the MC and that's the one that feels closest to AvPD in a weird way in my mind.

"Stress Relief in Making Things So last year, I went to a diner with my gf and I had myself a cappuccino for the first time. I've never tasted anything so delicious and I made it a goal to learn how to go about making one. After Christmas, I got myself an espresso machine. It would be a few months before I used it (lack of space where I live) but I finally got it set up back in November. My first drink, well... I never used a steam wand before. I watched some YouTube videos, my second cup was EXACTLY like what I had at that diner. Now I make about 3 cups a week or so (usually to keep warm more than anything) and it's expanding to where I got a coffee grinder so I'm not restricted by grind. If I want whole beans, I can work with them now. If I'm unsure what grind the bag I have is, pour some in the grinder to make sure.

Was it expensive? Well, getting everything together was about $260. With all the payment apps out there, it's affordable. You can make tons of stuff too. Lattes, mochas, I'll make hot chocolate with this thing. And I love it. If I have guests, I always offer to make them something. I found zen in the process, satisfaction in these product, and a desire to expand on what I know. It really makes me feel better knowing I can make something that not only I can enjoy, but friends and family can as well.

My advice? Learn a craft that you enjoy. If you like painting or even coloring, there's plenty of resources.

"Going out on a limb here - anyone else have benign brain calcification? I used to work at a cancer hospital and had severe health anxiety about brain tumors. I went to several doctors, all of which said I was healthy. I finally worked up the courage to go to a neurologist and upon seeing how anxious I was, she gave me a brain MRI. 

It turns out that I had an incidental finding which was “benign brain calcification”. She said it is unremarkable and the rest was deemed “normal”. 

I had another CT a year later, and the size was unchanged. So that could indicate I’ve just had it my whole life and means nothing, and they pushed the next CT to 5 years away (which would be next year or the year after). They did say that if I’m having symptoms such as a headache (they gave no other symptoms), that we can schedule it sooner. 

I’m just terrified that it’s multiplying in my brain right now or something. I have terrible health anxiety and get horrible symptoms, especially with vision. I’m just nervous that it’s the calcification causing this and not my anxiety. 

Has anyone else had experience with this? Or any doctors that can give me some reassurance? I know I should just make an appointment with the neurologist, but she already thinks I’m crazy and told me to see a psychologist about my anxiety (which I do) lol.

"Geodon Questions for anyone taking Geodon: 
what dose are you taking? Did you start at that dose or slowly raise? Do you take twice a day?

I'm taking 80 now. I'm not sleeping very good and when I wake up, I'm so groggy and feel horrible! Can't go to sleep, can barely keep eyes open but also wierdly restless. 

Did anyone have similar experiences when starting? Been taking for 18 days and 3rd day on 80. Couldn't get to sleep until 4am and up at 9am. Just now barely starting to function.

"I just got diagnosed After years of suspecting that I had bipolar disorder, I finally saw a psychologist and got diagnosed. I was really pushed to go after I saw how detrimental it was to those around me and the suicidal thoughts were becoming constant. I was a little disappointed when my doctor suggested medication to help with my treatment. I avoided medication for the longest because I would hate for them to zombify me. I don’t wanna be out of it nor feel unlike myself. 

This leads me to ask, does anyone have alternatives for treatment? Has it worked? How long until you noticed a significant improvement? I have so many questions after finally being diagnosed and I just wanna know how to cope and where to go from here. Any input is appreciated!",Bipolar

"Venting Sorry if this isn't appropriate for here, but the stress is killing me. I'm 24 and I feel like I've got the stress of a 45 year old going through a midlife crisis! 

Three weeks ago, I started up a new job with security, I got one 6 hour shift, and three 12 hour shifts. Honestly, I love this job despite the hours, and I can handle it. 

But, this past week? Everything feels like it fell apart. My sister popped over with her husband on a surprise visit ( haven't seen her in 14 years ) so it should've been exciting, but all it did was bring trouble to our already fragile household. She instigated drama with my father and everyone else, then her boyfriend was just causing problems with zero consequences. Then, two days later, my Uncle shows up and it's all great.. up until he hits me with news tonight that he's got cancer and he's trying to enjoy himself since he's scared of worse case scenario. All of this on top of family dilemmas with my father, seeing it affect my grandmother? ALL tied together with the very awkward sleep I get, I can just feel my mental health regressing back to incredibly old, toxic, unhealthy ways. I wanna smoke weed to ignore the stress and call off work, but I know doing all that will ruin any progress I've ever made. 

Oh, I'm also having allergies worse than ever so my nose is constantly dried up, in pain, slightly bleeding and my eyes itch like hell. I know I'm just yapping at this point, but good lord, it feels like way too much to stomach in such a short amount of time. 

Again, if this isn't the place, I apologize. Just looking for others in a similar mess, maybe I'm looking for some words of reassurance. Don't know, but thank you to anyone who fully reads this rambling",Stress

"Without negotiation we are expected to go to high school full weeks, go to college full weeks, go to work full weeks. After that, you retire, have a little bit of freedom and then you die.

If people want to work, they replace a robot. They do not get paid,because they do this for their enjoyment. I do not want there to be money at all. Maybe, more like an allowance that is just put on your bank account by an algorithm. Everybody gets the same allowance every month, it is enough to buy things todays rich people can buy, but not enough to let one person deplete an entire stock of something like luxury cars. Where you buy from, I want to be a algorithmic system that is backed by robots. So, if you buy a car, no person gets the money.

"Today, my parents and I had a conversation about my future. I told them I just wanted a job with a decent paycheck, because as long as you have enough money to get by that is all that matters right? They told me that I am too young to specifically choose a job, and then my dad asked me whether I liked sciences or arts more. Personally, I like arts more, but I do not even have any fucking time to learn to draw and animate. Why, you may ask? it is because my mom signed me up for so many classes that, especially during the weekdays, I hardly even have time to sit down. I cannot teach myself because digital art software always costs money and I cannot pay for anything online because I am too young to have PayPal, and it takes time that I do not have to learn how to use the software. Anyways, back to the conversation with my parents, I told them that I do not really have any choice but to become a doctor, and my dad said that I do not have to, but then he also told me that I should not really choose arts because apparently it is vague and you cannot really get a job in that. Then, both my parents started going on and on about how I should focus on my studies. My dad even told me that I should stop watching TV and YouTube and playing video games. Using social media and YouTube is my only refuge, the only thing that gets even remotely close to making me feel better. I am too young to choose a specific career path but too old to relax? It just does not make sense to me. He told me that it would only be until I finish my O-Levels and A-levels (O and A Levels are what we have for high school in my country, O-Levels is 3 years and A-Levels is 2 years), but I know very well that I will be just as busy even after graduating. I do not really like studying, I do not even have a favorite subject anymore because of how much I hate studying, it just makes me feel so trapped, that shoving my face in textbooks all day is the only way to success. Both my parents kept saying that I have to work hard, work hard, but to me getting out of bed is hard enough, let alone working. I did not mention that whatever mental illness I have (I have not been diagnosed yet so I cannot be sure) makes doing anything hard for me, because they would say that it is laziness not mental illness. Who knows, maybe I am just a lazy ass trying to make excuses. I told my parents that I did not want to become a doctor because it is not my passion and it is stressful. My dad told me, ""Oh it is not that stressful you can work in a clinic 9 to 5"" My mom tried to tell me some story about how she wanted to become a banker but she could not and that I cannot achieve my dreams because imagination is different from reality. Yeah, I already know that, I did not need her to remind me. I tried to tell her that I already know, but my dad said something along the lines of, ""Oh why did you stop her like that that is disrespectful is that how you talk to your mom?"" I had no choice but to stop that conversation because I was about to cry, and whenever I cry in front of my parents they give me shit advice when 90% of the time when I cry I really just want to be cuddled until I feel better. All in all, the conversation confused me, because my parents told me that whatever job I get should make me happy and that they are not forcing me to be a doctor, but at the same time what they said was definitely trying to push me towards becoming a doctor. Why else would they be telling me how good becoming a doctor is?Maybe my mom was right. Maybe it is time to say goodbye to me wanting to be an animator, or a voice actor, or an author or maybe a teacher, because I have to become a doctor to pay the bills and it is also my duty apparently to make my parents happy and to take care of them when they get old.However, if this is the life I have to live, I do not want to live at all.Goodbye dreams, it was nice knowing you. it is so fucking painful knowing that I have to let go of my dreams",Suicidal

Reality has it's own plans, to which remaining blissfully unaware can provide a temporary sense of comfort when staring into the face of eternity. Depending on others for happiness is a reliable way to perpetually avoid adressing the root causes that prevent you from finding it within yourself.

Even an otherwise functional and healthy relationship will crumble under the weight of one sides inability to truly form a connection, given they lack the emotional stability needed to build a solid foundation.

"Need to vent. I have had a partner for 4 years. It’s a shock to me, as well. But we haven’t had the greatest past. To make a very long story short: When he started medical school (4 years ago, when we first started dating), he wasn’t that nice to me. Some might say he was abusive towards me, especially when he drank. Anyway, he used my avoidant personality as leverage to skew many details regarding our relationship. It turned everyone in his life against me.

Now, my partner has sobered up. It took me a while to trust and accept this change. But the people in his life still haven’t let go of the past. And the truth is, neither have I. I’ve forgiven my partner but I haven’t forgotten how everyone else treated me, even after my partner tried to clear my name. It only augmented the characteristics of my AVPD. It dissuaded me from applying to grad school, seek any professional or academic opportunities… but mainly, it left me with an intense fear of leaving my house because I simply don’t trust anyone anymore.  

Today, my partner found out where he matched for residency. His school hosted a luncheon that celebrated the students who matched. So my partner invited me and his parents; and his friends were already there since they’re in the same class. Keep in mind that I haven’t seen anyone in about 2-3 years.  

After panicking for a week before the event, I finally mustered up the courage to go. I convinced myself it’s not going to be bad. My partner actually reassured me a lot, as well. Well….

Aside from my partner, everyone acted like I was invisible. They went out of their way to hug and greet everyone, and then skipped right over me. Even when I spoke, they wouldn’t acknowledge me. My partner was really disappointed in them but wanted to keep the mood light, so he didn’t confront anyone. He did stick by my side, so I was at least grateful for that. 

It all just augmented my social anxiety, avoidant personality, and even my body dysmorphia. Looking at the pictures I took of everyone else versus the photos they took of me…. I’m really struggling to decide if it’s just a bad day or if I’m really that hideous. It makes me never want to step foot outside again. 

My partner truly has turned his life around and has become more aware of my needs. I love him very much and am proud that he’s grown up a lot during our relationship. Yes, ideally we would’ve never had to go through our dark phase. But he’s helped me in many ways too. I just wish the people in his life were nicer to me.

"Horrible Fear of Food Being Drugged Lately I’ve been having this massively irrational fear of my food being laced with LSD or some other form of psychedelics.  I won’t eat something that’s been already opened regardless of whether or not it’s mine, which has led to me not only wasting food, but actively avoiding eating unless I make it right there, and even then it takes quite a bit of effort.  This in turn has also led me to having a fear of an undiagnosed mental illness, and I can’t quite afford to go to a doctor currently to figure out if that is the case.

I’ve only ever been technically “drugged” once when the cannabis my friend bought was laced with PCP a few months ago but this fear extends back to when I was around fifteen (twenty three now).  I’ve done acid only twice and while I did enjoy it, it’s not something I’m likely to do again, and I rarely smoke cannabis or drink, but I did do a lot of both for a few years.

  Obviously nobody is gonna waste good acid on me but the fear is constantly there to the point that I yelled at my brother the other day for jokingly pretending to drop something into my Gatorade on the way to work (he’s unaware of this fear) and threw it away despite it being completely full, and even avoided eating the cookies my mom brought down for Christmas, which made me feel awful as there is absolutely no way my mom would ever do anything like that to me.

I’m iffy on telling anybody close to me about this fear for a few reasons, the main one being the irrationality of it all, but I also do not want to be sent to an inpatient center (again, can’t afford it) as I was for depression as a minor.  Sorry for the rambling wall of text but I just need to know if this is signs of a more major illness or at the very least how I can possibly cope with it.",Anxiety

If there is a place in the library, I hope that nobody sits next to me or looks at me. I think people stare at me, but when I look up, they're not.

I avoid making friends at school because I feel inferior to people.

I can handle BRIEF, infrequent, surface level conversations. Anything more than that is a no-go. So I seem more outgoing than I am.

"I’m experiencing calf pain after a loonnnggg bus ride. DVT? Hi everyone, 

First of all, I’m a 27yo female who is pretty active and in general good health. I am taking oral contraceptives so I am at a higher risk of clots. I’ve been taking the same birth control pill for 10 years without any trouble. 

I recently went on a trip and was on a bus for 15 hours straight. I did walk around or stand up every few hours or so. I also had the seat next to me for myself so i was able to extend/raise my legs and stretch out. I was very hydrated during that trip. 

Once I got to my destination, everything was okay. I had to get back on the bus to go home, which was only going to be 5 hours (the first one took so long due to weather/traffic). I walked around about half way through my return trip, but i did notice my lower legs started to hurt towards the end of my trip. Also, i admit, i definitely wasn’t drinking as much water as i probably should’ve. 

It’s been 24 hours now and I’m experiencing mild pain in my lower left leg. My calf just seems crampy.  It hurts a little when i flex my toes up to the sky (that also hurts on the other leg as well). I do feel slight muscle spasms in my other leg but no pain. I have no noticeable swelling or warmth on my legs. The crampy feeling sort of extends to my thigh as well, but i do have sciatica so I’m not sure if that’s what I’m feeling. I can walk totally fine and have no pain when doing so. I mostly feel this pain when i am sitting or laying down. 

I’d love some advice on whether or not i should go to the ER to be safe or if it’s just likely my muscles are dehydrated and sore from being stuck in a relatively small area for a while. ",Anxiety
"Obsession as a feature of (hypo)mania? Around 2 years ago I spent a solid month with classic hypomanic features (feelings of grandiosity, sleeping less, immense productivity, etc). 

Afterward, though, the euphoria ebbed away. Instead, I became utterly obsessed with a friend. And whenever she got remotely close to someone else, I became *utterly convinced* that I was getting abandoned, and would sometimes do crazy things to try averting it. 

It wasn't even like the catastrophising that happens when I'm anxious/depressed. I truly 100% believed that Fate Itself had ordained she was destined to leave and no amount of logical thinking could convince me otherwise. 

Basically — do you think that might have been hypomania/a mixed episode? The psych I saw said that my ""feelings of being under-appreciated"" were a feature of depression, which makes sense given my low self esteem and self-harming tendencies in that period. But I don't think I was depressed? Depressed me never has so much obsessive energy. And in fact it was when I got properly depressed and anhedonic that the obsession gradually went away.

"Advice for me - diagnosed with depression, questioning bipolar This is something I just don’t know how to address.
I have depression and anxiety (diagnosed 2 years ago, but I’ve been aware of it for much longer). I was given 3 medications for my panic attacks and depression by my college’s psychiatrist, but upon her retiring, the college wellness center notified me that a nurse practitioner would be monitoring my medication from them on. I felt unsafe, angry, and wiped from the medication so I stopped taking it. I quit going to appointments, and eventually they billed me for all of my no-shows and never followed up.

For months after I went off my meds, I experienced suicidal thoughts, extreme depressive thoughts, and began self harming. This was very out of character for me. But I stayed off my mess out of fear of regressing. I somewhat leveled out.

I have a family history of bipolar disorder, and I’m getting close to graduating. I’ve been feeling very much unlike myself lately, and I’m (and my boyfriend is) noticing rapid mood changed from manic (cleaning the ENTIRE house, instigating fights, eating constantly which I’m not sure is exactly manic but I can’t regulate it, and rapid thoughts) to depressive (laying in bed and threatening to never get out, crying before every shift at work because I’m just so tired, feeling like I’m making no progress and just feeling small). My boyfriend has told me at times he feels in-equipped talking me through these episodes. He’s expressed that I should consider going to therapy again.

I’m graduating in December, and I just feel like potentially being diagnosed with something else or being recommended new medication can ruin that. I’ve worked so hard to get here and I want my degree. But I feel as though it’s irresponsible to put off taking care of my mental health.

I’m also pretty poor so therapy would be tough for me to pay for. I do have insurance though, so I don’t know how much of a difference that could make. I’ve only ever received free therapy. 

Does anyone have recommendations? Is it worth pursuing a diagnosis for soundness of mind, or is it possible for me to just recognize that in myself and adapt? I limit alcohol intake, as that typically makes things worse for me. But I’m afraid of taking medication because I’m so forgetful and anxious about actually going to refill my prescription.

We both suffer from medical issues but not the same on mental health. I am not the type, typically, to open up to anyone or do things like posting this here. Realistically a stranger does not know you so opening up to one does not mean anything. Venting does not change facts or pain. I just want it to stop. I ride my zx10 150-180 pretty much everywhere in hopes that I hit some gravel, have a car pull out, or do not negotiate a turn at high speeds. I drive my little wrx way to reckless in hopes of the same. My buddy is scared to get in a car with me, or do activities, since I have no sense of self preservation. All my activities have become meaningless and not even fun even more. I used to go wheeling in my taco every Friday and loved it. Id enjoy fly fishing trips, sitting on a porch for 6 hours just staring at north Idaho beauty. And now None of it brings me joy. I even asked my wife for a separation and moved her back home out of state because I cannot open up and I just do not find happiness in her, or anything. I often find myself sitting in a chair, staring at the water thinking, hoping, today is the day I have an accident. Also, everyone dies. If something happened then all sadness will pass. For my (part time) kids it will pass, my family will forget, people move on. Second hand suicide + Pain + PTSD",Suicidal

"I could use some reassurance. Swollen lymph node, getting a biopsy Friday I have been having reoccurring sinus infections due to a tooth that needed a root canal. During that time, I went to an ENT who told me that my nose was a bit crooked and that was another reason. 

While I was there I thought I'd ask him about a lymph node in the back of my neck. When I first discovered it I thought it was a knot in a muscle so I tried to massage it out but it never went away. Eventually, I asked my GP about it and he said not to worry unless it grows. I don't think it has.

I told him that it had been there for at least 2 years but more likely 3-4 years. He asked if it was stable and I said yes but he wanted to get an ultra sound. 

The ultra sound tech said she thought it was just a lymph node. I asked if she thought there was cancer in it, and she didn't think so but would let my ENT make that call. 

I went to the follow up and he mentioned the ultra sound doctor thinking it was a lymph node but wanted to get a needle point biopsy on it. He said that 9/10 times it was nothing but he would be a bad doctor if he didn't check. 

This triggered my health anxiety. What if I'm that 1/10? My brother had lymphoma when he was 27, and I'm 31. So I'm terrified. 

I poked it, and it got harder, and my neck got sore, and now I can't stop checking it even though I know I need to. I'm trying not to push on it and just brush my hand across it, but it's still there and it's still freaking me out. 

A few weeks ago I had a routine physical and my blood work was normal. My white blood cells were high but they were at 8 and the range was 1-10 was normal. My GP didn't think anything was wrong aside from minor cholesterol stuff that he put me on vitamins for.

So I'm getting the biopsy on Friday, and following up on Wednesday to get the results. But in the meantime I'm spiraling here and looking for reassurance or help. 

I don't feel sluggish (aside from being tired, I have a very active 11 month old baby.) My color is good, no fever, no night sweats. I have chest pain but that's just anxiety that comes and goes with my panic attacks. My appetite is fine. My blood work came back fine.

"Apologies for the somewhat misleading title. I am not exactly sure if it can be changed.As a student, this is my life:Go to classes - gets anxious because as soon as something becomes hard, I tend to ruminate about it and lose focus. Everything is an effort - do I do any work? Hell no. I am very lazy. I just cannot bring myself to do anything.My room is a mess. Cannot stay organized for the life of me. My desk was full of papers but they were only chucked on the floor so I could put my computer there to do remote learning. After I leave a class, I am meant to do work assigned by the teachers. Do I do that? No. Every test I have studied for has been the night before. Somehow I am getting decent grades. But I feel like I am not living up to my potential and I am more stressed and anxious in the process.The thought that everything is too hard and having unrealistic expectations is killing me. I am just unable to do things for some reason. I have no idea if this is an executive function issue, my anxiousness about perfectionism holding me back or because of my flat mood. The doctor was suspicious when I mentioned ADHD and said I sound more like an anxiety and depression case. The indicators of ADHD I do have are: executive dysfunction - trouble with executing tasks, cannot sit through tasks like lectures that require sustained attention (unless it is the night before something is due), often has uncompleted tasks, often makes careless errors. But I am unsure if anxiousness about performance is causing these things to occur. The thing is, I have felt like this since early in life. I hardly remember the bulk of my childhood but I remember even doing homework in the class right before I have to hand it in. Homework that did not matter. On that note, maybe I keep doing this because consequences do not really seem to affect me? there is also emotional dysregulation. Up until my teens, I had a very low frustration tolerance (and still do now although I have learnt to express it in different ways) which would result in yelling at my parents and having breakdowns. A few were to do with school because I could not handle the pressure. I also have a foggy brain. Probably because of sleep deprivation that happens sometimes due to staying up too late.Lately I have been feeling really flat because I have developed low self-esteem and the thoughts, ""I hate my life"" or ""Why do I exist?"" have been popping into my head, and they are enough to make me cry. Every single day. On top of the possibility of having ADHD, life is scary. Every little setback makes me cry. I cry more than the average person. Rejection hits me incredibly hard - a friendship breakup and bullying at the beginning of my teens turned me into a nonfunctional human being and I never understood how people can get over that shit so easily. It took me at least a year to fully get over it and forgive the other people for their shit in my head. I mean, I did have no support during that time so I guess it is understandable. I am weak and not very resilient anymore. it is like I am a shrivelled plant and I want to give up. I feel like I do not have ADHD and I am just lazy and depressed, and I am trying to give myself an excuse for not trying hard enough. Maybe it is mild or sub threshold, but still there. Who knows. I cannot cope anymore. I have no coping skills whatsoever except numbing the pain with music only to find it resurfaces later. It is not problem focused coping. I also have no hobbies. I cannot stick to anything. Maybe because I do not achieve mastery or a good standard in a short amount of time?I feel like the last time I really lived my life was when I was a child, happy and using my imagination. Since ""teenagehood"", my life has been a downhill spiral, and although I have got a wonderful and supportive bunch of friends and family, and I have so many opportunities, I have still turned out like this. tl;dr: feeling incredibly low and hopeless, anxious about school, possibly dealing with ADHD symptoms and it has been on my mind for a while, which is causing me to feel worse.

"Experiences with Lamictal and hypomania? Experiences getting off Lamictal? Hi! This is my first time posting here. If I may, do any of you have experiences with what I put in my title?


Here's some (not super necessary for answering my questions) background:

I have a diagnosis of Bipolar type 2. While for many reasons I still believe this to be accurate, I've been questioning the role that Lamictal has played in my illness and diagnosis.

While I had had many sort of hypo-hypomanic periods before, and had actually been diagnosed before at age 13, my first full blown, classically symptomatic hypomanic episode coincided with starting and then increasing my dose of Lamictal. This particular episode was used as a part of my diagnosis. (I started Lamictal due to a severe upswing in my depression and history of not responding to antidepressants.) The hypomania eventually faded back into my more typical depressions and general emotional static. This was then further complicated by the addition of other meds that I did not do well with at all. It's a bit of a tangle, so attempting to determine if there's any sort of clear chain of cause and effect is difficult.

I've never had any other side effects, but I've also never really felt any steadier on Lamictal. Lithium is what eventually became a total godsend for me.

All of this is to say that I don't know if Lamictal has actually done anything positive for me. Yet I've been kept on it ever since and I'm questioning if this is only because I haven't had any side effects to complain about. If this is true, is there really any point to continuing to take it long term? If I don't have to spend the money every month and continue to risk the known short term and unknown long term side effects, I'd rather not.



So, has anyone else experienced hypomania that coincided with starting or increasing Lamictal? Has anyone gone through getting off of it? What is the process of doing that like?

I am, of course, not going to change anything without talking to my pdoc. I'd just like to hear from some other people with personal insight.

Thank you!",Bipolar
"Fear of TIA To preface this I have a long history with hypochondria, I have for years and it was getting better but recently it's been worse. I haven't had the outbursts I used to have but I guess that's because I keep it to myself

One night he said something degrading and I decided to leave but instead he assaulted me. No one believed me not even the police. I later found out that this well put together person had had other restraining orders against him and had been in prison for eight years. That was shocking. Anyway, I developed PTSD.The year following this I started drinking heavily on the weekends to forget. I also exercised a ton and lost a lot of weight. that is when I met the father of my son. I thought he was a great guy and he treated me so well that I let my guard down. I was so scared of having sex but I did it. I told him about my sexual assault and was understanding. I found out I was 5 weeks pregnant. I also found out that week that he had a girlfriend whom moved down two months after I discovered my pregnancy. That made my PTSD spiral out of control. I regained composure and was thankful that I was pregnant and made it my mission to have a great pregnancy. Quite frankly, I never want to date again nor do I miss sex. My main goal is to be a mother. Well, my little boy is two and I beginning to suspect he has autism and its taking a toll on me.

"I can't cope with my job I work from home as a software developer, most aspects of the job are too triggering, and I can’t handle it.

Every morning starts with a daily update meeting. Since I usually had done only 0-30 minutes of work the previous day, I have no update to give, I panic and have to lie, and the lie is transparent. Afterwards I have to cool down from the shame, guilt, and stress. It’s already hard to recover from the procrastination because everything I do, with the code or on Slack, has a timestamp, a notification, and is visible to everyone. Once there’s something I’m avoiding (committing code, deploying code, posting the code for review, responding to someone, testing code, an upcoming meeting, etc.) I often go offline from inactivity, and then I’m afraid to even open my laptop (which can take hours to overcome) because once I do everyone can see I’m online on Slack; my procrastination then is immediately visible to the people who are impacted and who are looking for it i.e. people I’m not responding to, my manager.

I already got in trouble for not doing my work, missing meetings, not responding to people for days or weeks, and just not showing up some days without telling anyone. I was put on a month-long probation, which I’ve gotten past only because I didn’t ghost entire days during that time. I have frequent meetings with my manager and I have to pretend I’m struggling way less than I am. I can’t admit that half or more of the days I do absolutely nothing, or how much communicating with people — the most important part of the job — so fundamentally terrifies me.

I know every trick in the book about procrastination, time management, breaking down tasks, but that’s not enough when I’m this afraid of people. I’ve accepted I need help from another person. I’ve talked about this some with friends, but none of them understand, so all they can provide is sympathy. I have a psychiatrist and I’ve been trying to find a therapist, but they’ve all been unhelpful, many actively harmful.

I know it's a slow process, but every single day at work is like torture, and I’m on very thin ice. Because I can’t get the work done, it’s not endurable, and I don’t have the time or energy to work on all the other parts of my life in dire need of work.

Also, since October, I've been having very vivid dreams almost every night-  never ending ones. And I never wake up feeling like they're good dreams.

"Is the stress of my international sales job worth the benefits? Looking for guidance….. Hi,

I’m a sales director who recently received a promotion to build and lead a new sales operation for an Australian media company in a foreign country. After relocating my family and settling into our new home, I found the job to be manageable, albeit stressful, for the first 8-9 months.

However, after a year, I've realized that the stress has become a part of my daily routine, and it's starting to change my personality. I'm experiencing burnout, feeling completely drained, unmotivated, and even depressed at times. I report to upper management located overseas who may not fully understand the realities of building a new operation in a foreign country. Despite being expected to do more with less, the results are still expected.

I'm struggling to decide if I should push through this or throw in the towel. On one hand, the benefits of international experience, such as building and managing a team in a new market and exploring new commercial initiatives, are invaluable. On the other hand, the stress is taking its toll, and I'm not sure if it's worth it.

I'm interested in delving deep into my psyche, but she doesn't seem as curious as I'd prefer. She doesn't ask enough questions and seems to assume a lot about me as if my concerns are simply general concerns, with general roots behind them. She talks specifically about surface problems, but vaguely regarding experiences and the reasons for problems in this life. I know that we all share a lot of the same feelings and experiences, but that's not what I'm interested in emphasizing, and to be honest, it doesn't make me feel better. I already know other people feel similarly to me, I already know that, but I also know that everyone's experience is different. People go to these pages to feel less alone, and it does help slightly, but that's not enough. I don't care to hear that I'm normal, it just feels minimizing. I want to connect with people but feel utterly incapable of doing so, even when I put myself out there and have conversations, I feel like I'm not really there talking to them, and they're not seeing me. My therapist wouldn't even see the AVPD, she thinks I just have depression. I don't know what to do, I'm scared to open up to her about my concerns, I don't know how I would do that. CBT is helpful in that it gives people practical ways to help themselves and take control of their lives, like taking small steps, for example. But, it's not enough for me.",Personality disorder

I feel like being isolated and particularly avoidant over the last year has completely fried what little personality I had.

"Some tips to save $$ on Latuda I keep seeing a ton of posts about how expensive Latuda is for people and of course many posts about how helpful it has been. I must say for myself it has been helpful with the depression but its certainly not a fix all for me. So with that I wanted to share some tips of what I have encountered along the way with trying to afford and stay on this medication. There are some options or relief available. Not sure I'd call them solutions but instead kind of band-aids. Ultimately it wont get better until generics come out but from what I have read it doesn't look like the patent will run out till like 2026 or thereabouts.



1. When you get the script from the doc make sure to ask about samples if they are not provided first off. I got lucky and I have to say I was on this med for probably a good 3 months just on samples alone. Perhaps my practice is a bit more forgiving on that front.  I told them I had problems with getting the cost (which I did) so they gave me more samples to hold me over till payday.  There were also times I ran out before the pharmacy could get an order in, and in which case they gave me samples to hold me over till I could get filled.


2. Get the discount card!!! It says pay as little as $15 which for me brought my cost down to $150. Not great but far less than what it was. [Latuda copay Assistant](https://secure.latuda.com/secure/latuda-savings.cfm)


3.  Check if you have a preauthorization requirement for this drug. Unfortunately this might require you to call your insurance company directly. Some pharmacies might be able to tell you if its required. For me if my pdoc didnt submit a preauthorization the cost for me was near retail which is about $1300/US.


4.  Check if you have a prescription deductible. I did and at the beginning of every year it renews. So I was surprised to find that my drug I was getting for $150 was now ringing up at $400. Sadly the only way past this is to pay it. But once paid, my cost was back down.


5. McKesson the company that provides the discount card will also provide you with two 14day supplies of latuda at no cost.  That is right, **FREE**.  Just today I got my second free 14day supply of latuda. Call them up at 1-855-5-LATUDA and you can speak to a rep to get this. They will provide you with the info that is used the same as another discount card.


6.  Lastly I was told of another option they have available where they will supposedly try to negotiate a lower cost with the insurance company. I'm not sure what kind of success rate there is with this as I have not yet attempted to go this route. This will be my last ditch effort before telling doc its too much and have to find something else. In order to do this you would call the same number above 1-855-5-LATUDA and inquire talk to someone about what options are available and perhaps inquire specifically about negotiating how much the insurance cost/pay.  I only found out about this one as my insurance is always rejected with the card so I called the card company to sort it out and was somehow transferred to a rep that informed me this is what her department did, before transferring me to another.  


Anwyays, hope this helps some of you. The preauthorization and deductible points should apply to all medications and is something to consider. Its possible that the other solutions might work with other medications as well if they are cost prohibitive. 


Edit:  Looks like the patent does expire on July 2 2018. So perhaps there is hope for a generic sooner than later.",Bipolar
"On Sunday night I tried to kill myself by hanging. I choked until I passed out, and awoke violently gagging - I ran to the bathroom and threw up, and spent the rest of my night on the bathroom floor. The next morning, I spent my time walking around like a zombie, and when I got home I thought I wanted to try again - I decided to call mental health services and they decided I needed to get myself to the hospital. After realising I am physically ok and there is no permanent damage, I honestly feel lucky to be alive.Depression and suicide have surrounded me for the majority of my adulthood. My dad committed suicide when I was 15, and I do not think I ever fully resolved the trauma from that event. I have consistently felt on and off for the past few years, but my suicidal thoughts culminated on Sunday night and resulted in me trying to take my own life.My ex girlfriend, who I was with for nearly 6 years, came over and repeatedly twisted and manipulated my feelings to the point where Id never felt more sick and used in my life. I begged this person to come back in my life, and I am deeply ashamed - not because of showing feelings, but because I now know that this person has never caused me anything but pain. Over the years, I feel that she conditioned me into complacency, and gradually tore down my personality into the person who was happy to be stuck with someone like that for the rest of their life. Looking back on it now, in a calmer state, and with the perspective that all the loved ones who have come by and supported me have provided, I now realise there is not much of this person I wasted so much time and energy on that actually value or respect. She could not talk or communicate like an adult. She was incapable of seeing the effects of her actions on other people. She was selfish. She made poor decisions, and was incapable of looking after her health and hygiene properly. She had very few friends, and repeatedly drove people away due to her personality. She was always so quick to judge and criticise others, especially me, without ever turning the magnifying glass back on herself. She humiliated my sister about her botched tattoo, despite having an absolute clusterfuck of poorly assembled tattoos mismatched all over her thighs. She hated cheaters and how people functioned in their relationships, yet complained about me to her male friend, and gaslit me into thinking I was crazy for hurting from it. She criticised other peoples health and appearance, yet only continued to gain weight without doing a single thing to change. She often shamed me for how I chose to dress, despite often having pretty poor hygiene and being quite unappealing as a result. I now realise just how much this person had thoroughly poisoned my floor, and convinced me I was not worth anyones time or effort. Begging for her affections is the most regrettable thing I have ever done, because I now realise that this was the ultimate symbol of how she would conditioned me to submit to her disgusting behaviour. As she revealed details of getting drunk and sleeping with someone earlier in the week, despite never wanting to be physical with me at the end, confessed details of drinking alone recently, and went back &amp; forth on getting back together to play with my feelings, I think the veil broke in my mind and I finally started to see her for what she is. This person that I had put so much time and energy into, who I had thought I loved with all of my heart, just uses people and discards them. As I sat in the hospital and received an outpouring of support, I realised just how little she had ever done for me. Id received the most heartwarming messages of love and support from women I had slept with once and kept very poor contact with. If all of these people Id only spent time with for one night, just to get physical, could offer so much support then why could not someone Id know for most of my adult life? She blamed so much of her toxic behavioural and personality traits on past relationships, and even puts her various supposed mental issues in her Tumblr biography as some sort of attention seeking excuse. This person is just a complete fraud and I now realise what an absolute manipulator she was. there is such a huge reason for her lack of success in making genuine friendships, and the gross people she is now seeing are just even more evidence of the fact that she will take anything she can get as long as she can use them for something. She has no dignity or respect in my eyes and I truly regret I let someone like this shape what could have been my last day on this earth. Last night, a complete stranger came up to me and told me as a dad, he felt so much sadness and concern for my well-being that he had to say something. He gave me a hug and told me that he saw how much love I have to give and I should not even be here. After how much crying Id already done that way, I could not believe how much hope I felt in my heart after hearing that from someone who did not even know me. I would need 4 hands to count the number of people who have offered to come over, who have spent time with me today, and just given me a phone call to let me talk and finally express the pain I have carried for so so long. Some of my dearest friends have been so fucking supportive, and understood the pain and abuse I had endured for longer than anyone should have had to bear. I am sure things will not always be easy, and I know there will be times where my thoughts take over and I want to do something terrible. But after the ordeal of the last few days, I finally see the support that I have, and just how much I have going for me despite not realising it. I have made an interstate move happen all on my own, and been approved for my dream apartment. I am going out and meeting people, and (TMI) having really awesome sex after being with the most stale and unfulfilling sexual partner I have ever had. I go to the gym most days of the week now, and find so much enjoyment in working myself physically to improve my health. I put more time into my hobbies today, and found renewed vigour for guitar practice and my music theory work. I am practically drowning in job opportunities and have never felt so excited about the prospects in front of me. There are so many good things on the horizon for me, and one awful person should have never gotten in the way of that.All this is to say, I know that despite things not always going to be easy, I am glad I survived and that I am going to be ok. A lot of the work is on me and it will take a lot of effort, but I know what I need to do. If anyone has ever been in a position like mine, where someone has treated them this way and they feel there is no hope, just know that they are just one person who is trying to project their own shit onto someone else. For every one person like that in your life, you have 30 more who genuinely care and love you and want you to be ok. It was true for me, and I want this to be true to anyone who has gone through what I went through. Attempted suicide on the weekend. Now I feel so hopeful for the future.",Depression
"The fear just keeps getting worse and I need some advice Hi all,

I've had health anxiety ever since I was a little kid,but this past month I have  been unable to manage it anymore.I know that what I feel and fear is irrational and improbable, but I can't seem to make myself truly believe this.

 pregnancy very unlikely),after PCOS treatment completely fucked up my cycles.Two weeks ago, I had an ultrasound to ease my mind and everything came back negative, which relaxed me for a while.But now I can't stop worrying about an ectopic pregnancy that could rupture at any moment and kill me.The doctor only checked my uterus and ovaries,and because of this I worry that  she could have missed it if it  was ectopic.I've been having a lot of cramps and spasms, pain that goes from my neck to my shoulder and a couple weeks ago I had an episode of really bad sharp abdominal pain that I attributed to bad nutrition and stress.

"Heart/health anxiety Hi all,

30/m/New York

This post is about my struggle with health anxiety and the fear that my heart is failing. 
Might be a long one but would love to speak to anyone who has/is going through anything similar. 

I have had anxiety for years but have been able to deal with it until recently.

4 months ago I had some chest pain which caused a massive panic attack. The only way I can explain the sensation is that it felt like someone was grabbing my heart and squeezing. 

A couple of days later I went to my doctor and had all the necessary tests. Blood work, EKG, echo etc. All results came back fine, as expected, except for the fact that I have an oddly low pulse (53 most of the time) and the chest tightness remained. 

Over the next few months my panic attacks became less frequent (twice a week) and my chest tightness began to disappear.

I managed this by reminding myself throughout the day of any moment where I was distracted enough to feel normal. An hour or two went by and I would be suddenly be reminded that I’m not dying. I feel great. It must all be in my head. 

I had also started weekly therapy during this time but I didn’t find it particularly helpful. My therapist mostly talked for an hour and guided me through breathing exercises. I think what I really wanted was to find the route of the problem.

More recently, my panic attacks have been worse and more frequent. 
I have been feeling heart palpitations a lot, or more accurately, my heart skipping beats.
I began checking my pulse and counting the beats fairly often at this point, causing more anxiety and more panic attacks. 

Now I’m obsessed with my low pulse and my blood pressure machine. Almost all results show high blood pressure with a pulse of 51.
 
I have just had a heart monitor on my chest for 48 hours and won’t get the results back for another 10 days or so. 

And this is where I am at…
Frequent panic attacks and the constant thought that my high blood pressure and low pulse will either kill me, give me a stroke or make me faint.

Anyone else gone through this?

"I'm a lot scared about my mom's lower leg pain Hi! First of all, I made a second account to talk about these personal issues, I use my personal account (which has my real name) for a lot of public things and didn't feel comfortable in sharing those personal issues there.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom had breast cancer six years ago, and treated it successfully, doing chemo and radiotherapy. Fortunately, it was diagnosed very early. She is totally cured now, and constantly monitors her breast and

 thyroid (which she had some benign cysts). She is 60 and doesn't smoke or drink at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Last week, she removed a dot on her face. The biopsy returned Basal Cell Carcinoma, but with no spread on close lymphs. The dermatologist said it was nothing to worry about.

&amp;#x200B;

But yesterday she said she had been felling pain around the tibia for about a year and half. It's a pain she feels deep, that comes for some time (like a week), then disappear for some months, then comes back. It doesn't seem to be affected by exercise, but hurts at night. While she was pressing the region to show me where it was, she said she could feel it hurt a little, even if, at that moment, it wasn't hurting the way it used to. There is no swelling at all, and she said it never was. She also said the pain is the same since it begun. 

&amp;#x200B;

And she had been having some cramps a while ago, the doctors said it could be a neuropaty caused by the medications she took, like tamoxifen. She also said these cramps usually stops when this pain begins.

&amp;#x200B;

She said she's worried about it being a bone metastasis from the breast cancer.

&amp;#x200B;

From what I know, it's extremely unlikely that a metastasis from a cancer she treated back in 2013 (and which, in that time, had no secondary tumor detected) could only appear now. 

&amp;#x200B;

But I'm extremely worried about other cancer possibilities. Like a primary bone cancer, or a secondary cancer from a hidden tumor that originated in other part of the body.

&amp;#x200B;

The rational part of me says it's probably neuropaty, or even some other symptom caused maybe by her age, and if that pain was bone cancer, she probably would be gone now, or at least the pain would have gotten worse after all this time, or even some swelling would have appeared.

&amp;#x200B;

But the other part (the same that worried about me having ALS because of some twitches) says it could be cancer. She has an appointment with the same doctor that treated her cancer on Monday, but, until then, I can't help but be terrified about this possibility.

"Self-Fulfilling Prophesy: *The sociopsychological phenomenon of someone ""predicting"" or expecting something, and this ""prediction"" or expectation coming true simply because the person believes it will and the person's resulting behaviors align to fulfill the belief.*I have a lot of anxiety about the upcoming immigration to from Russia to Israel, where my parents live now, and I have been feeling afraid that I would be denied entry after I have done all the work they asked. I have been chatting about it with my gaming friends for a while, which would calm the nerves a bit. But I have been feeling angry at my gaming friends today. We used to be tight when I was in the you.S. being in the same time zone made it easier to play games together than it does now. Our little group helped us get through the pandemic, as we would get online every night and play PUBG, Apex, Destiny, and many other games we tried over the year. And our little group grew - first it was just the three of us, now it is seven. We also knew most of each other IRL, so we would hang out at a bar or play D&amp;D together.When I moved back to Russia in April, I used to ask them every day if they will be on, because I have got no other socializing going on for me except for family. Every day I would wake up at 7 AM on my time just to speak with my friends. I would spend a couple of hours with them, before they would peel off to sleep, and then spend the rest of the day anxious about immigration.But as the time went on, I started to get less and less responses. I would ask in our chat if people were planning to be online in the evening while it was still morning over there, just to make sure that everyone got to reply. Also, so I would get ample time to see their answers, to know when I should wake up. Initially I would get many confirmations, then less and less, then people stopped answering consistently. Eventually I would feel lucky if I got so much as a no. The distance separated us. Over time they have become busier with jobs picking up after COVID mandates lifted, with new partners, just life. I however, regressed: I am alone (or more accurately, feeling alone), I got no job, I separated with a girlfriend of 7 years, because the distance and the uncertainty of whether I am coming back to America and when, made our relationship impossible. Chronic depression became more consistent. I started to realize that I was angry at them for moving on, for finding people closer to them to spend time around, for hanging out together without me. I started blaming myself for feeling angry and upset that I was not getting the socializing I needed. I have had my depressive episodes and they have offered support over chat, which was a nice gesture. But I realized that I was angry because they said, They were there for me, except the times when I needed them. I cannot blame them for not noticing that me asking if people are online in the evening is a cry for help. That I am desperate for human contact other than my family members that I am forced to live with because I have nothing else in Russia. That I feel alone in a crowded room.I feel lonely. I feel unwanted. I feel unattractive. I feel like I am nobody. I feel like I have got nothing to offer. I feel let down because I have let myself down.I had a dream about living in the you.S. till the day I die.I LOVED living in the you.S.I feel like I have let myself down because I had not fought harder for my right to be there. Because I have not explored more options for stay. Because I did not participate in the Green Card lottery consistently. Because I did not save money to go to Grad School. Because I did not confront the Executive Director of the facility I worked at as a Counselor when he denied my request for a work visa, which they did sponsor for past employees.During these 8 years I have learned the language almost to perfection, I got a college degree, I have worked, I have got a B.A. in Psychology, I worked again, I asked, politely to let me work longer. I did everything right. And it was still not enough.In my academic life I have felt like I was barely passing, that I was procrastinating and not doing enough. I feel like I do not deserve both of my degrees. In my work life I feel that I was lucky I got my job and that I did not deserve it. That I was not doing more than I possibly could, even though some days I would work for 15 hours straight during a pandemic, ears red from the facemask loops, then falling into my bed half-dead, after driving home for an hour, so that I could be up in another two to do it all over again.And still I feel let down because I believe I let myself get kicked out of the you.S.And now I sit in the apartment in Russia, struggling to send out the paperwork for the Israeli immigration, because I am afraid, I am going to fail at that too. I choose not to act because I do not want to disappoint myself again. And it will come true, because knowing all of this is not enough motivation for me to do something about it.So, all I got left is the feeling of anger at the people who cannot play with me no more.

Meanwhile, when I observe the way other people talk is like they always have something to say, some comment to make or something to keep the conversation going, and it seems so natural for them. I always get afraid that people will like other people more because they can offer more during a conversation than I can, and honestly I think this has been proven true over time.

When I observe other people interacting I can see them using these a lot (naturally; I feel like a robot because I had to sit down and actually think to came up with these and have to make an effort to put them in practice) but even with this system, I'm still having problems because, like I said, a lot of times I simply can't think of anything.

"Bothered By Unhelpful Thoughts? It can happen so easily. You’re trying to concentrate on your work, and your mind wanders off to a completely unrelated topic. Or, maybe you’re about to go on a first date, and all you can think about is how horrible your last few dates have been. 

**Unhelpful thoughts can be distractions or be destructive.**

Your mind is incredible. When you manage your thoughts, you have your mind working for you. Imagine how powerful you would become if you could ignore or replace your negative thoughts! You could accomplish more and get greater enjoyment from your life.

### These strategies can help manage thoughts that don’t support you:

**Maintain space between yourself and your thoughts.** You don’t have to engage with your thoughts. You don’t focus on every person, tree, and car you pass when you’re driving down the road. Most of these things pass through your awareness without you pursuing them further.  
 

● You can do the same thing with your unhelpful thoughts. **Allow them to simply pass on by.**

● Your thoughts are simply something that you experience - you are not your thoughts.   
 

**Recognise that it is your brain’s nature to produce random thoughts.** The thoughts you experience say little about you. It’s the nature of your brain to produce thoughts. It’s always going to give you something to think about.

● Occasionally those thoughts are useful. Frequently, they’re frivolous. Sometimes, your thoughts can be quite disturbing. We have evolved to pay more attention to negative thoughts: with self-awareness we can see them for what they are and then move on.  
 

**Meditation is a helpful tool for understanding the nature of your mind.** The first thing you notice when you attempt to meditate is the random and restless nature of your mind.  
 

● **Focus on your breathing.** When you find yourself fuming about your boss, wondering what happened to your high school friends, or making a mental grocery list, simply redirect your attention back to your breathing.  
 

**Focus your attention on a thought of your choosing.** You can think about anything you choose to think about. You can think about riding a flying bicycle, eating a lemon, or what you have chosen to accomplish today.  
 

● When you’re experiencing an unhelpful thought, you can decide to think about something more useful. **Recognize that you have the ability to direct your thinking as you see fit.**  
 

**Apply logic.** Poor thinking leads to poor decision making. When your thoughts are leading you astray, put your logical mind to good use. Ask yourself what a sensible person, or your role model, would do in this situation. What would you advise a friend to do?  
 

Are negative or distracting thoughts getting in your way on a regular basis? You’re not alone. The human brain loves to stay active and will wander from one idea to another until you take control of it.

**The key is to focus your attention on what you choose, recognize your random thoughts for what they are and allow them to pass.**",Stress

"there is a plethora of ways I could kill myself at this moment, many of which would be pretty painless. Or at least, I would not be in the right mind to feel the pain if I were to commit.But I cannot do it.Is it fear? Is it that I still want to live? Nothing actually seems particularly wrong with my life, so is it just a phase? Am I trying to be edgy? I do not know. I am not even focusing on what the title of the post says, I just wanted to write something.Also just realized that I might have imposter syndrome, which is fun.I feel like I am just fucking things up for myself despite having everything I need around me. I feel like I do not deserve to contemplate suicide because other people have gone through actual, real pain. I am at a time where I should be finding focus, where I should be giving it my all, but everything I have done up until this point feels pointless and I feel I will never achieve what I want even if I tried now. I hate myself making things so much harder than it needs to be. And I hate myself for not even trying to make it better for myself. Can this even be called being suicidal? I do not know. I might be overreacting. But at the same time I want to die. I do not want to turn 18. But I am turning 18 soon and I do not know if I want to just end it before I have to face becoming an adult or if I should try to survive by then because I know that there is still a chance to improve. This is just a full on rant, no one's going to read this. I want to talk to someone, but I do not know if I can trust them. I am afraid to find out what would happen if people knew that I have these thoughts. Would my friends and family still love me? Would they see me differently? Where do we go when we die? Do we get reborn when we die? If I were to die, would ""I"" ever feel the sensation of having control over body and thought again? Is it worth finding out? Should I try now? Or would it just be endless nothingness forever for me? it is fucking cold. I have a hoodie on, but my body feels like there is chills all over it. I do not know who I am anymore. I spent my whole life buried in textbooks and nothing else and now I am crumbling under the expectation that I have to apply for uni, whether they will even accept me, why I did not do anything in the past few fucking months I had to do something about this worry. I am scared I am going to disappoint everyone, because I know I made them all believe in me. But now I feel like I am going to betray them by either fucking things up for myself or just ending it all. I do not want to sleep, and I do not want to wake up. I do not want to fail, but I just want to end it all. Who decided that life had to be this confusing? Who decided to give me this fucking brain that thinks these thoughts? I am scared to find out if I would actually kill myself before my birthday. it is only a little bit away. I do not want to put that burden on my family. I know that they love me. I love them. I am fortunate enough to have them around when I cry, so I do not know why I am even having these thoughts. I do not deserve to be like this. I wish I spent my time doing at least something else. Maybe then I would have a better idea of what life is about. Of whether or not my worries are even important. Whether I deserve to cry.This was a long rant. I doubt that one can even form a reply to this. I just wish I could pick something and stick to it - either try and give it my all or decide to end it all now.

"Does Anyone Ever Question Their Diagnosis When I was diagnosed as bipolar, I had already had my suspicions.

"Bipolar w/ ASMR (sidenote on New Age culture &amp; spirituality) Anyone else experiences ASMR on top of your manic episodes? I have type 1 ASMR and Bipolar 1 and I've found it to be a deadly combination. When manic, I'll come up with these metaphysical laws and--despite how compulsive and irrational as fuck they are--  get this huge flood of stimulation from the back of my head all the way to my feet that makes it seem like the universe is confirming my understanding. It got to a point in my development where I believed I was given the date of the end of the world and that the afterlife was split 80% enslaved and 20% saved. 

Months later, my life has blown into ruins and what was once seeming so inexplicably clear now seems psychotic. Is there a lesson to be had from all of this or can it all be written off as manic thinking? 

Sidenote: what's extra complicating on top of all of this is the thirst that new age culture seems to have on pondering spirituality and metaphysics. On the one hand, it's nice that there is a community (albeit niche) that embraces neurodivergence and ""out of the box"" thinking. On the other, I'm finding it dangerous because of the community's willingness to affirm these manic thoughts that Im having as reality. The twofold affirmation had me push towards accepting all these thoughts as absolute truths and burning bridges with people that wouldn't accept what I was experiencing. This ended up being a lot of fucking people and I ended up homeless. 



Yes, I understand that ASMR is a scientifically controversial subject, but it seems there are enough people out there that experience the symptoms of it to talk about it. If you don't know what I'm talking about: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_sensory_meridian_response",Bipolar
"TLDR; bf is getting more depressed over time. I am trying so hard to get him the help he needs. I am getting pushed away and its affecting my mental health now. I feel like everything is pointing towards us breaking up.we have been dating for about 1.5 years. I have GAD and moderate/mild depression. I am currently on medications and in therapy. He has severe depression (and anxiety I suspect), and has been in therapy before. Hes going back to therapy, but there were not any availabilities until August. He has a history of getting depressed in relationships (previous two gfs and me).He and I have similar histories. Both our families had pretty nasty divorces. Both of our mothers developed cancer while we were still young teenagers. Our families are in similar geographic regions. We both had a relationship that was emotionally abusive. I guess I mention these because it was easy for us to understand each other when we first met, but also because I think these could have impacted our mental developments and relationships.Both my partner and I are in graduate school. He has a major exam coming up that determines if he will qualify for candidacy. This exam has been looming for a while and has been pushed back a couple of times because of COVID, but also because he was not prioritizing preparing for it. This stressor is contributing to his depression.The other stressor is our relationship. Its been on the rocks for a couple of months now. He left to visit family in May and he was not in the mood to have sex when he came back. I miss the sexual intimacy, but I am much prefer physical affection and emotional intimacy. Having said that, its always been hard for him to open up to me. In June, he did something that really upset me at the time, which started his spiraling. I have since forgiven him, but I do not think hes forgiven himself. He admitted hes been depressed for a while now. I did not see the signs very well and attributed it to stress from his exam (before I knew our relationship was also stressing him out). He said a lot of self-hate things and started punching himself in the face. I called his dad and told him what is going on because I felt like I could not be his only support. we have been in limbo (how he described it) since June. We did not see each other much the first couple of weeks because we both needed space. After that, I have been the one initiating contact and hanging out to get a feel for things. we have been telling we love and miss each other still. However, he told me this weekend that the physical affection is hurting him and he was not comfortable with me going to our mutual friends because he cannot be a boyfriend right now. For 4th of July, he also did not act like my boyfriend.This really hurt me but I have been trying to listen to his needs more because of his depression. Hes asked for more space to focus on school, which also hurts but I do the same when I need to get work done. I have tried to get him into our schools counseling between now and his regular therapist, but he does not want to talk to a new therapist. I have also tried to get him to couples therapy. He said he would go, but its obvious he does not want to be there, so I have not scheduled anything because I do not think it would be productive if he does not want to be there. I have asked if I can help him around his house because he is not taking care of himself. I have asked how can I support him, which was the space mentioned above.He does not know what he wants in regards to us. I do not know if its the depression talking. Hes scared if we have an on and off relationship that I will eventually leave him for good because an ex did that. Hes thinks I am disappointed in him (I have never said this, he sets these expectations for himself) because he cannot be a boyfriend right now. I feel he does love me because 1) friends and his family have told me he loves and cares about me very much, 2) he showed it through his actions before all of this, 3) he told me he loves making me happy. But, my doubts have been creeping in. He said his depression is getting worse. He does not want to see me, I feel like I am walking on eggshells because I cannot tell him how this is affecting me without him spiraling, and I just feel like I keep hurting him when I am trying my best to help him. I cannot help but think his feelings for me have changed.I love him so much for so many reasons. I loved him early on in our relationship but I wanted to be sure it was real and not infatuation, so I did not say anything until maybe 9 months in. I wish he could see what I see. But him pushing me away is hurting me and affecting my mental health now. My anxiety is through the roof and I can feel my depression starting.I am not exactly sure what I am looking for from you guys, but thanks for reading if you made it to the end. My boyfriend is pushing me away and I am at a loss",Depression

"Going at your own pace I believe some days ago there was a post about being tired of importance of communication skills in life. Now, there's kinda similar issue but with the pace that everything's is going with. Just my personal experience, I am not speaking for everyone. So, last year I quit college cus I couldn't bear stress and deadlines. I was pretty slow to understand and do things that was required, professors (or whatever they're called, sry not sure) were pressuring us a lot with all that and so on. I have a job as a stocker now but in about month or so I have to think about other options for studying (colleges/universities, just some other field), and that honestly makes my stomach twist. It's not about what I want, it's about how it'll all go. I'd love to spend my time studying art but I am so afraid of the process. When I think about it, I can imagine only flaws and mistakes I'd make. There would be so much things to learn and practice but so little time to do all that. And now to the title. I hate that everything must be spinning crazy like that. If you want to study, you must be catching up quickly, otherwise it's immediately your one big ass problem and no one is willing to help you with that. It'd so damn cool if there was any way to get education on your own pace, so you have enough time for everything. I know it's only in my dreams but I can't stop thinking about it. I am so slow because my brain is so fried after all these years fighting this plague. I don't know, maybe it's just me and I am that broken but it's really so sad that I can't normally go towards my dreams.

"Feeling like I don't do enough I'm not sure if this is due to the disorder or not, if it's imposter syndrome, if it's from old Christian mantras of ""put others before yourself"" being baked into my psyche since childhood, or if it's a combination of all three; but I often feel like I don't do enough for other people in my life. Whether it's with other family members, close friends, or co-workers, I often get this sense. 

I work from home. And I've done a lot on our current project over the course of this past year. But now that we're sitting near the finish line, almost ready to go-live with not much else to do other than wait for the cutover, I can't help but feel some kind of guilt like I'm not doing enough. Even though I helped our team make a ton of progress in the past few months. 

With friends or family it often comes in the form of ""should I be there?"" or ""I know I be there, be present, but I really don't want to"" and then I just feel like a POS terrible friend/sibling/son/etc. for not doing it. For example, a relative of mine had a gender reveal party a few weeks ago. Naturally, I didn't go. I'm not particularly close with this family member and haven't been for years. Nonetheless I still felt like an asshole for skipping. Especially later when I talked to my dad and asked how it went;  I asked ""who was there?"" and he said ""Just about everyone. Except for you"". I don't think he intended to make me feel guilty, but it kind of did. My mom corrected him later and pointed out a few other family members that didn't make it, but nonetheless I felt like I didn't do enough. Even though, again, this relative having the child and I don't really talk or show interest in one another's lives anymore. 

Another example is a friend, a close friend, who really does their best to help me get out of the house and do things. They'll invite me to things at bars or restaurants, and 9 times out of 10 I don't go. Part of me appreciates the hell out of that, because I need it, and it's nice to be included/wanted. Another part of me wishes they'd leave me alone; because I don't think I'm interesting enough or worthy enough to hang out with. Then I start feeling a whirlwind of guilt and shame for bailing out of the request. 

Wondering if all these feelings of guilt or shame are part of the disorder, or if it's something else. Anyone else experience this?",Personality disorder

"I created CocoonWeaver to help. It’s a free, privacy focused app that sorts audio recordings, transcribed, into categories. There are numerous benefits to self talk, in particular it can decompress mental states and reduce stress. I hope you enjoy! Sometimes, it’s overwhelming to think about all the stressful things. When you let go of them, you can take solace in the fact they remain in a safe space, but no longer occupying headspace. I developed CocoonWeaver because of a dream I had. My dream was about an app that would be intuitive enough to release the many fleeting thoughts that occupy ones mind. Since then, it has been developed in to a working product, and improved with the help of kind feedback from various neurodivergent communities. I would love to take feedback from this community as well, if you have a moment to download the app and share your feedback I would be extremely grateful. 

The app is completely free and it is completely private, nothing leaves your device and everything is stored on your phone.

"Deep down I feel like my mom sees a part of herself or someone she knows inside of me and she hates it. My mom knew how bad. I stressed and why I would have breakdowns and she wonders why I was how I was when I was younger. She found my suicide journal when I was a freshman I think it was and I lied that it was not mine. I remember she said I knew you could not have wrote this but little does she know I have always been suicidal. The first suicidal thought I had was when I was 4 I remember I fantasized about death and that lasted for a few years then things got bad and I would pray to god to help me and kill me even. I love my mom with everything I have but I know she is damaged too and its not her fault that she is the way she is, I do not blame her. If I was in her shoes I would have gave up on myself.

"Throwaway, my wife knows my main. I went to a lawyer last week to get an idea of what divorce is going to look like for me and my kids. She cheated, I tried to move past it but I can not.

That and I will have to pay support, more support until my stepdaughter is 18 and out of high school, even though she gets CS from the father. I work at a family business, my dad is retiring and for 14 years I was planning on taking over. When I learned of her infidelity I told my dad I do not want the business because I can not handle that level of stress. I learned I can not function with a high stress life. Everyone has stress, but other people's livelihoods in my hands, I could not handle it. I am stuck in a marriage I want out of but cannot afford to end, and I am facing unemployment in the next few months, and I have never put together a resume or had a fucking job interview in my life. The only thing I can hold onto is I cannot do that to my children. I can not scar them for their lives. I need help but cannot afford it.

"Does anyone else feel like they're too ""boring"" to have friends? If you ask me what my hobbies are, I can't name any. If you ask me what my talents are, I can't name any.

I follow current events, politics, foreign policy. I read the Washington Post and the NY Times and The Economist. I listen to podcasts. But to me, that's not so much a ""hobby"" as just part of being a responsible citizen who keeps up with what's going on in the world. 

I try to go running or ride my stationary bike a few times a week. But again, I don't see that as a ""hobby"" but just doing what we're all technically ""supposed"" to do to minimize the risk of health problems. 

None of these are things that really bring you closer to people or are conducive to meeting them.

When I was in college, there'd always be some guy who was an amazing guitar player and people would just magnetically gravitate toward him and just ""vibe."" I've never had any musical talent. 

Or people would just play frisbee or pickup soccer. I've never been able to do something like that. My body freezes up, I panic, I'm afraid I'm going to make a mistake and everyone else will get mad at me. In middle school PE, if we had to play soccer or basketball I'd always just stand as far off to the side as I could and run *away* from the ball if it was anywhere near me; if I was getting in trouble for that I'd say I had to go to the bathroom or wasn't feeling well and needed to see the nurse. In HS, I ran cross country precisely because so much of the competition wasn't being watched, you didn't have to do anything with other people, and if you messed up it was solely on you and nobody else would get pissed off at you. A lot of people seem to do things like play softball or volleyball in rec leagues and I wish I could do something like that without having a panic attack and feeling like a fucking spaz. 

I've never really played video games. When I was growing up, my parents basically forbade me from playing any that they regarded as ""too violent"" which meant nothing like Halo or CoD or the other popular franchises people would get into. And I've always avoided them as an adult because if I started spending a bunch of time playing video games by myself, somehow that would make me feel even *more* isolated than I already am.

I've never really done any traveling because I've always felt too self-conscious to take a trip by myself. (I'm a guy so I don't have the excuse of safety, which can be an issue for women doing solo travel in some parts of the world.) In college, I never did any kind of study abroad because I was afraid I'd get there and nobody would like me and I'd basically be trapped there for weeks with no way to escape. I'd feel embarrassed about not being able to speak to people in their native language (even though virtually no Americans can do that anyway). I see people on social media backpacking through Europe or Asia and hanging out with all these people they just met and I have no fucking clue how they pull that off. 

Does anyone else feel this way? Almost like you're just a Non-Player Character in a video game who doesn't really get to have their own story while everyone else is going on adventures through life? If I meet someone and they ask what I ""like to do"" I basically draw a blank. 

Or, if not, do you have any suggestions for how to make yourself more interesting?",Personality disorder

And if my natural burn rate is 2000 calories a day and I eat 500, that is only 1500.

"I do not know who I can talk to, or say anything regarding to to in person. I know that it is not right. I have been suffering for the past month, when me and my ex broke up and I came back to my home country as I had moved to be with her, I had hope we would be together again at some point etc, and seeing we were renting a place together I left her all of my money so she could afford the rent as alone she could never. So I did, however I have her bank account on my phone (did not anymore) because we shared it, so I kept getting notifications about deliveries, such as uber eats, deliveroo, just eat (fast food). My money was partially being used for this on a daily basis, over 100 pounds were used in under 5 days. I contested her about it she kept treating me like trash, and I demanded the money back with the promise that I would send her the money back when rent was due, atleast this way I knew it would be there for the reason it initially was. She ended up sending me the money, we talked a couple times and everytime we did she would rub on my face how much better she is now without me, how she is quote on quote ""living her best life"", and obviously sure this is fair but I do not want something rubbed on my face such as that when I am clearly suffering. The following day we talked again and I told her that I truly plan on killing myself, and whilst I was explaining why and how she messaged me her PayPal mid video call, to send her the money before I do so. Yesterday (17th) was the day I was supposed to give her the money back and I ended up not doing so, because I do not deserve to be treated like this, or atleast I do not. I was insulted by her on many different occasions, kept being told I am a horrible person and manipulative, she kept saying ""yea everyone said you would not send it back yet here I was thinking you would have some consideration in you"" , when well...I changed countries in december just to live with her, so I feel like she cannot contest that I care for her. Nonetheless yesterday our final message before she blocked me on a social platform was her telling me ""all the stuff you have on your instagram saying you hope we will get back together, and one day our paths will cross once more, forget about them because I will not allow myself to stoop so low for someone like you"" and that really hurt me, and although I feel like she will not ever come back, I did not want that to be said it that way. I was really hurt all day yesterday and had really awful dreams regarding this situation. I woke up and I heavily started considering, flying back to her country, murdering her and killing myself. I do not know what to do. I cannot exactly explain why this would be the right decisiona nd I am sure it is not however, it feels like for once she would understand even if for a second, how it is to be on the suffering side.

"I have fried my nervous system! How to get back sensitivity? Cant Feel anything, not even myself

Sorry for posting so much, but i Feel like my actual soul and presence is gone from my body. Like literally just burned away. 

I Feel i have emotional numbness, like actual numbness. I have emotions mentally some times, but my body and brain is like physically numb so i cant Feel them. 

I Sometimes get hints of emotions in my body, but it is also distant and numb. And i cant Feel it.

My body is just a body, and i am just a mental voice. There is no presence or life anymore. 

I have no emotion or feeling of anything. 

All feelings left, and the last to go was the feeling of myself. 

Music and food and the sun and my Friends. All gone and no feeling. How can i Feel music if i cant even Feel myself. 

No desires, or motivation or sadness or love. Just nothingness. 

I had a physical feeling that my brain was empty, like a physical feeling of a room inside my head, like my brain
Like you can physically Feel your brain is empty. This feeling is also gone. I cant Feel my brain.

Mine went away, and now i dont have much in my head of thougts emotions and feelings.

My memory is complete crap. 

I live life in this strange 2D without any feeling or emotion. 

I dont know if a constant state of hyperarousal and OCD might have fried my brain. Also bad reaction to B12!

"Uncontrollable HIV anxiety New to Reddit so I apologise if this post is a little all over the place!

So I've struggled FOREVER with anxiety. I'm a 22 year old girl, whole jadda-jadda about troubled childhood, absent parents etc which I think has contributed to it. Over the past 3 weeks I have been utterly destroyed with anxiety that I have HIV. I've been diagnosed with OCD and depression in the past, as well as always having intrusive thoughts and being convinced that I'm on deaths door after panickingly Googling symptoms.

So basically I met a lovely guy, we really hit it off, going on lovely dates every day for about a week. Then, VERY out of character for me, we got drunk and slept together (every kind of sex, for those interested). I barely remember it and the next day I knew we hadn't used anything because we couldn't even remember how we got home, let alone anything else. Cue a panic just as we went out for breakfast the following day, and I asked if he 'had anything'. He said no, and seemed pretty offended. Well, if he was offended by that, he was even more offended when I said I thought he had HIV and proceeded to pester him all morning about when was your last test? Where do you have them done? How many people have you slept with? 

I physically couldn't eat for days, and I spent the next 2 days having to make myself sick because the anxiety was making me so nauseous. I was shaking constantly, waking up in the night in a hot sweat. In the end I spent 5 hours waiting in A&amp;E until 1am to get PEP. I had to exaggerate to get it (the guys parent's are Ghanaian and Nigerian, he was born in Cuba, but I said he was Ghanaian because I know there's a high rate there). I remember the doctor saying to me ""okay so there is some risk"" and I just started crying. I was exhausted and malnourished and felt utterly convinced at that point.

The guy in question has been so lovely. He knew how anxious I was and he picked me up the following day at 7am to go to the local clinic to prove he didn't have anything. I'm currently taking PEP. All my friends think it's hilarious how anxious I am, but honestly this anxiety is killing me. I can zone out for a good 10 minutes straight thinking about it. I'll think things like, what if I've actually got it from a previous partner? This guy has tattoos, would they test for HIV before that? What if he's taking me on all these lovely dates because he does have it and wants me to fall for him before I find out the truth? 

I had a blood test done at the end of January which was clear, and my blood test from A&amp;E was fine, and I tested negative for everything except a water infection. Even then I was thinking what if the water infection is the start? I sneeze and convince myself these are the flu-like symptoms. I see a spot on my body and I'm convinced that is the rash starting. 

Does anyone else suffer with this? I'm scared that even if I get a negative result that my anxiety will continue. ",Anxiety
"gender rules &amp; being in a relationship as avoidant guy I don't mean to offend anyone beliefs, just a thought came to my mind and i want to discuss it with you.

recently , i redownloaded dating apps and started chatting, seeking friends and relationships.I was chatting with this girl, and we talked about many things. One of them was relationships, she told me that she prefers to be in a relationship with traditional gender rules.this made me think and realized that a relationship with traditional gender rules isn't for me, and i think this mainly has something to do with being avoidant. 

 these are my reasons

I don't initiate or take actions. Usually, i respond to actions, even sometimes i don't respond to actions that other people would respond to, i rarely take actions or be proactive.

I lack assertiveness

I've been suffering a lot recently, and I am on medication and undergoing therapy, but these bouts are cyclic, I always end up back in this position after a while, perhaps not as severe as the one I'm in now, but I feel that it's in part due to having such little recollection of my childhood (can't remember much of it or my teen years), I want to be able to have a definitive answer to whether I was sexually abused so I can put it to rest, the not knowing is really hurting and the flashbacks I have are intrusive and upsetting, I don't know how to confront this situation and get over it.",Stress

Shes let me live with her and help out with the house for some years not but shes tired of me and how I cant ever finish what I start. Or how I hyperfixate on things but haven't made any money.  She gets verbally and emotionally abusive towards me and in the past when this happens I leave but now I have no where to. This week I've been taking the car and doing everything I can to make some progress. I even made an appointment with a new therapist and filled out job applications.

"Doctors notes/records Hi just wondering if anybody knows about if doctors think you are drug seeking do they put that on your record? 
I went to doctors yesterday, didn’t see my usual GP, it was about spinal pain that radiates up my back, only seems to hurt after physical activity which is weird but concerning to me. The day before appointment I went gym &amp; done some light training on back muscles which really set it off, was painful &amp; felt weird afterwards like weakness in my arms, bit dizzy and just a general weak feeling like really weak and disorientated. She was not helpful at all, basically done a quick op’s check, checked my back briefly &amp; said it seems ok. She said to rest on weekend and see how I go, she said hot water bottle. The more im thinking about my appointment with a her yesterday I get the impression she feels I was drug seeking. I never asked for any drugs but I feel she was misunderstanding me being concerned with trying to get drugs. She said something when I sat down like “you’re looking to discuss pain management” I didn’t really take it in as was really anxious and tired so I said yeah about my spine then proceeded to talk about my concerns, but not once did I say anything about wanting medications/drugs. I’m annoyed now I should of been clear that I would of liked a referral to be checked out or something. I’m on pregabalin for anxiety (it also just happens to be a nerve pain drug) and she said few times about you’ll have review soon with usual GP to see if it’s helping my anxiety and not just about pain management. She also said you’ve only upped dosage 10 days ago. I didn’t really take it in properly at the time but I feel she thinks I was trying to up my dose or get pain meds? I’m worried now that it will be on my notes and I’m also frustrated that I didn’t correct her properly. Any advice or help on this would be appreciated im very anxious about this, I feel I was totally misunderstood and I don’t like the thought of her putting on notes I was looking for pain management or medication to help that. I also noticed as I was leaving she done a frustrated sigh. This experience has made me feel invalidated, misunderstood and made my anxiety and depression worse.

"Am I choosing the right mindeset? I wonder.. is it my stress, time management, or myself as a person in general that is blocking myself from doing the best I can? Or is it my anxiety and overthinking getting to me?

I am a F14 in my freshman year of high school, currently going through a roller coaster of thoughts and emotions. I'm trying really hard managing between piano, soccer, and my grades with school. I love everything equally, (well maybe except school..), but in the end, my grades are my priority over piano or soccer. I know that piano and soccer may benefit me throughout high school, but grades are more important. But that doesn't mean I'm going to give up on neither one. 

But here I am with a B- (84.5) in my history class, and I need to get it to an A- (90.1) by the end of my school final which is in about 2 months. Well I'll need an A- at least, so I could take AP Euro in my sophomore year, and it's only available in my sophomore year as well. AP Euro is definitely not a necessity for my next year in high school, but it'll benefit me a lot, and as my school is very tough and competitive, I want to achieve my goal and do it. My teacher is crazy strict, being 87 years old, he has his more ""older-fashioned"" and more ""understandable"" ways of grading. So I stress trying to fit into his perfect standards, but at the end of the day, I keep telling myself. In the future, there will always be people that will be wanting a perfect requirement that fits them. I will need to be able to be adjusting to those specific requirements, for the future, to benefit myself and my ideal career future and more.

I've never gotten a B, or a grade range in the B section (B-, B, or B+) throughout middle school and my first semester of high school until now. Is it the stress that's piling on me after all these hard schoolwork I'm not managing well or enough with my time that I have? My sleep schedule is actually horrid, I usually sleep at 2-4AM waking up at 6AM, with soccer practice 3-4 times a week (usually I skip at least 1 day a week since it's a little too much), and 2 lessons of piano a week. Also including the clubs I've decided to join, Mock Trials, which is now coming to an end with competitions. Volunteering, which I guess I could choose which days to help out.. but.. The homework. The load at my school is actually crazy, about 2-3 assignments new each period, which is every day, so in a week total about 30-40 assignments, which is quite a buttload. It's due either the following days, or sometimes, a miracle as it is it'll be due next week. But then again, there's at least 1-2 tests a week, which I need to study a lot for. Oh of course, there's also the projects and essays, let's add about 1 for every other week. 

Should I take a break from piano or soccer, and put my grades at my priority instead? I think I can be able to take my grade, 84.5% up to a 90.1% at least, which is \~6% of a percentage raise that I'll need to be okay. Telling my friends this, all I get in response is the same, ""It'll be okay."" All I wish these days is someone to tell me more than ""it'll be okay"". I'm still new to the environment of high school, and figuring out what fits for me, and what doesn't fit for me. Encouragement, something I haven't heard in awhile, is what I hope boosts me. Thanks for reading this far.

TLDR ; Not having the most decent grade in history class (84.5%), wanting to take AP Euro next year for my class, I need at least a 90.1% for my requirement to join the class. Struggling with the management of piano and soccer as well for my extracurricular activities, as well as school clubs, should I take a break from something? I need to put my grades before other stuff, including the fact to not freak out with studying and use time well. Also wish someone could tell me, I'm able to do it, and they have confidence in me. Thanks again.",Stress

"Where I end and bipolar begins: passion? I'm not sure when I began having bipolar symptoms. But for most of my life, I've been very cyclic. I don't think I was stable for most of my adolescence. It is very scary for me to look back on my life. And think of how most of the times I really felt like MYSELF were when I was most likely manic. 

I used to be very goal-oriented, loved to learn, passionate about my hobbies. Just passionate, passionate, passionate.
But not always. I would slip into depressive phases and either lose interest in things or stop entirely.

When I think of myself, I think of someone is incredibly passionate. But that doesnt describe me at all. I feel like a husk who used to be someone. I still like the same things. But I never learn, or do anything anymore.

I used to write essays for fun. I used to practice Japanese religiously. I used to be so passionate. 

The scary thing is. I think my passion and vigor was never me. It was mania.

I'm scared that I was never anything but manic or depressed. I'm scared that's all I'll be. Or a husk.

The only moments where I feel like myself are when I'm passionate and working hard. But I haven't felt a single flicker of that passion since I had my manic episode. 

I just feel blank. Sometimes depressed. Sometimes stable. Mostly bored. And I'm scared to feel passion sometimes. Because then...its mania. It must be mania. 

I dont know how to separate who *I* am from bipolar disorder. Is the me that I appreciate just my manic self? Is this passionless, semi-depressed, stay at home, jobless, college drop out...ME?


TL;DR: My identity is being passionate, being hardworking, a love of learning. I'm scared the past me was just manic and that I will never have that kind of passion again (unless manic). What separates ME from bipolar? I am currently a husk of my old self.",Bipolar

"Thismay sound batshit, but I think my night vision got shittier to prevent hallucinations? So I'm bipolar 1. When I was a teen, I used to habitually hallucinate at night, seeing shadows as things they weren't, picture things lurking in corners, hear things, etc. It kept me up for hours with lights on, hoping the images wouldn't become more vivid or real feeling. Most times they didn't. Sometimes they did.

Ever since I started getting medicated, though, my night vision has devolved into shit. I physically cannot see in the dark no matter what, not without a source of definitive light. 

While medication severely lessened hallucinations, it didn't rid me of them. I still fairly often hear things that aren't there. But night hallucinations? The inability to see has made them nigh impossible. 

Is it possible my brain decided to rewire itself a bit to make my life easier? I mean, it's done that before when I grew to be more introverted and self-sustainable socially, or re-conditioned  my conscious brain to want and need more sleep.

 If so, hecking wild. If not, a convenient coincidence. Nighttime hallucinations always really fucked me up but it's hard to create any visions out of the pitch black.

"Losing sleep over losing sleep I might have a stomach ulcer. Maybe, probably? I went to a doctor who said I might have an ulcer, but didn't do any tests. Two weeks later I went to an urgent care doctor because I had been up 30+ hours with discomfort and nausea. They did a blood test and said I was h. pylori negative, but I'd been on Prilosec for nearly two weeks and apparently that can affect the test outcome. Was told to keep taking the Prilosec. About a week later I went back to urgent care because I was still losing sleep over nausea. On three or four occasions I have woken up in the middle of the night overheated and needing to vomit, almost fainting in the process. I also have pretty consistent abdominal pain across the entirety of my abdomen, which worries me because Google says that I'd feel pain only in the middle. 

I have really bad anxiety and this health crisis has spiraled me into depression as well. I've changed my entire lifestyle in the last month over this--all I eat are carrots, potatoes, apples, peanut butter, and yogurt. All I drink is water.

"Some Questions From a Newly Diagnosed Bipolar Person Hey, I am 18 and male and diagnosed bipolar. 


Currently, the only things I am taking for my bipolar disorder are NAC and fish oil. 


I am also diagnosed adhd, so if some of this is irrelevant, to Bipolar disorder, I apologize in advance.


Onwards with the questions:


1. My psychiatrist has tried to prescribe my mood stabilizers (most recently lamotrigine), and I have refused to take them. I really enjoy the high feelings I get and don't want to give them up. I also am deathly scared of putting any drugs into my body. I do not even drink. Has anyone tried this drug? What has your experience with mood stabilizers been?


2. Some months, I legitimately cannot focus. Like, even reading for me is just not going to happen. I meditate every day, and during some months, getting my self to sit still is a near impossibility. I am a master level chess player, but I have to play multiple games at once to properly stimulate myself. I have found that intense exercise (especially weights and competition) help a bit. I have also used audiobooks. Does any have any other coping strategies when they cannot focus?


3. I am hypersexual. Like, it is all I think about. If I wasn't so busy with sports, academics, and music, I would probably sleep with a different girl at least every week. I don't even really enjoy it I just sleep with a girl within 30 mins of meeting her at a party or on a first date and then I feel like shit the next few days. Then, I think I really like her for a sec. Then next week I decided I am bored with her and it's on to the next girl. 


The only girl I didn't get bored of was this other girl I slept with who had bipolar disorder too. She was just crazy enough to keep things interesting. She got a boyfriend though.


I really want a stable relationship, but my habits seem to prevent that. On top of that, I have a horrible reputation because of the number of girls I have slept with and the way I have slept with them and used them mostly for sex (although I have always had consent and never slept with even a tipsy girl).


How do you guys hold down a stable relationship? It seems hopeless with hypersexuality, boredom, and mood instability. Speaking of which:


    4. How do you deal with loneliness? I have many friends, but I still get lonely. I use sex to cope but that is clearly insufficient. A relationship would be ideal, and I am working on it, but is there anything else I can do?


    5. How have you reconciled giving up these manic episodes when they are so appealing not just because of the emotions but also because you are better at everything, confident, and able to have life experiences you would never otherwise have.


    6. How do you explain to your friends when they ask if you are on drugs right now or comment that it is like you are either ""marijuana [your name] or meth [your name] depending on the week."" I don't want to tell them I am bipolar (and I didn't even know for sure until recently).",Bipolar

"I Found What I Was Looking For I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in April 2012. I've struggled with the illness since I was twelve-years-old, and initially I was diagnosed with unipolar depression. I've been hospitalized more than ten times. I've been suicidal countless times. Without my medication I experience so many manic breakdowns-breakdowns that are terrifying. 

I came to terms with my illness in October 2016, after losing someone that I love with all my heart. When this person severed our relationship, I realized that I needed my medication to make the paranoia, the delusions, and the recklessness go away. It was through this loss that I saw the light. 

But, it was as of recently that I realized the way I treated people and myself, and my perspective in life was also unacceptable. I have a strong support network, but I disclosed everything under the sun to anyone who would listen which is not good for anyone's self-esteem. 
I was the proverbial empty barrel that made noise-all the contents of my barrel would spill out into the ocean that is life. I was unable to love myself, so I sought that love in others. I revealed everything about myself in the hope that someone else could soothe my pain, only to scare away people that just wanted a healthy relationship with me. I am sharing my story because medication saved me from the mania, but it was mindfulness that saved me from myself. 

I realized all the love I need is within myself, and that I don't need to turn to others to soothe my emotions when meditation coupled with medication can lead one to find the peace and bliss we are all looking for.

I had an experience recently that kind of personified how I went about learning to cope better.

After i took a hit, I had a hard time accepting the reality of the situation, which is the key point I am making here. As I have improved with my anxiety issues over the past year, I took up smoking weed again for a while, with very little anxiety. A couple weeks ago, I smoked more than I usually did, so the set in was much more intense. Although it felt good, I noticed there was some anxiety building up in the back of my mind. I began to panic. But I decided to try just letting go, and accepting the reality of what was happening. No more anxiety, I was able to enjoy the drug.

"I found something out today that feels like the light at the end of the tunnel that Id previously given up searching for. While I probably cannot end my struggles with the aid of therapy and medication (trust me, my family and I have tried continuously to no avail), today I read that a man in Quebec, who had a neurological disorder similar to Alzheimers (although he had not allowed it to progress to a stage wherein he became somewhat of a mental vegetable, he had lost many physical capabilities and securities and wore diapers at the end of his life) qualified for medically assisted death under new legislation, when previously ones death had to be within the foreseeable future.At the end of the article it mentioned that while persons suffering from mental illness do not currently qualify under this legislation, they will as of 2023.That being saidits been a rocky road since 1999, but now it looks like I can finally be at peace with myself because there is now hope for people like myself, who found no relief in medication and therapy, for whom there previously was no hope. You do not have to struggle with the constant (or not so constant) thoughts of suicide and trips to the hospital that sometimes involve admission to the mental health wards.

"Storytime... Hey, so... I've made some realizations in the shower as I do what most of us do and plan out the conversations I'll be having in two weeks because I know it's going to happen and I need to be ready or I'll just clam up and nothing is going to happen. We've all been there, most of us are still there, let's talk about what I'm thinking about in this little vent sesh. 

Alright, so I was showering, thinking about how akward it's going to be when I tell my friends some secrets. Wow! I know, sharing secrets! It freaking sucks!

So basically, I'm part of a church group, and these people are closer to me than my family because I don't like/trust my family and being around them is stressful. These friends that I hang out with all the time are my safe place and they make me feel...happy really. 

Though I don't share everything, these people are genuine and kind, and they always make me feel safe. It's just that, I am going on a mission trip with them this summer. Going to Africa, and it took them months to convince me to come with them. I still don't like the idea of going, but knowing that I'll be with them the entire time makes me feel much better. Besides, I used to fly a lot so the plane ride will be pretty nostalgic for me.  

So, as part of going on the trip, I have to do a few things. One thing that I have to do is research a topic on one part of the trip and give a presentation to oir team (9 people including me). I trust, love, and feel safe with everyone on this team, and all but one of them have been my closest friends for almost 2 years now. I couldn't ask for better friends. 

Anyways, the presentation I'm giving is in two weeks and I'll be discussing the entertainment part of the trip. Basically, I just have to research what kind of entertainment there is where we're going and make a small (mostly funny) slideshow. It doesn't even have to last 5 minutes, but honestly...this presentation is the least of my anxieties in this mess. 

Another thing that I'm going to have to do is share my testimony. That is essentially a summarized version of your life story. I'll have to talk about my troubles, my past, my family, all of it. And these are my friends, they'll know if I'm holding back. But it scares me so much! Half of them don't actually know I have avpd! They just know that I've been going to therapy for a while and that I started taking medicine. Though, the medicine is kind of iffy really. 

Anyways, I'm super anxious about it, especially since I did something similar last year, but that was at the height of my emotional suppression. This time last year, I was so empty and emotionless. But of course, nobody knew. I was always masking my emotions and faking a smile. I didn't even know I was doing it, and when I gave my testimony for last year's mission, it was incomplete and full of holes. I talked about my lack of friends, but I was blind to the emotional abuse and neglect from my parents and siblings because I had convinced myself that I was just weak and that my pain was normal and even less than what everyone else had to go through. 

But it's not like that, that's not how I should think about my past pain. It took so long for my friends to break my barriers, but they managed to do that and convince me to go to therapy.

 I'm much better now, but I'm also not suppressing my emotions. It was really hard at first because everything just hurt so much and it overwhelmed me. One moment I was putting on a face to fool everyone into thinking I was okay, but as soon as I was behind closed doors, I was hurting myself and cursing the world for letting my life be the way it was. 

The fact that I have to go and tell my friends how I've been feeling over the last year is overwhelming, but I am not allowed to go on this mission unless I share my testimony. It's only fair though, everyone of us is sharing our testimony, no matter how much it hurts, we're going to be here for each other.

"Distraction techniques? I suffer from extreme health anxiety, my main fears being that I will spontaneously drop dead from a heart attack or stroke.

"Mania, Hypersexuality, Relationship, Mlehh... Ugh. I already typed like 3 paragraphs and it all disappeared. Anywho, as indicated, I'm experiencing my second manic episode in a four month period, despite meds. I'm not complaining! But what I'm getting at is that I'd appreciate if you just bear with me. TIA.

In my last manic episode, I expressed my hypersexuality by posting in GoneWild-essque subs. That's what I'm doing this time, but also selling content and it's just not enough for me. I want to meet some of these people I encounter and it all just seems so RATIONAL in my head. Like, not everyone is a serial killer, right? The only problem I see is my boyfriend, and that is obviously a bigger problem.

Ah, my boyfriend. He is amazing. I love him so much, I just want MORE. Like, I want to do the things I want to do and come out together at the end of this phase I'm going through. I've never had that kind of freedom before. I've steadily been in relationships for almost 10 years now and only been with two people in my life. So it seems fair to want to explore a bit, doesn't it? But I don't think it's fair that I'd have to sacrifice my relationship to do so. Ugh.

I really can't afford to be in this kind of a headspace. I'm starting college back up tomorrow and I love my life. I had a talk with my boyfriend though, and he said once he is comfortable with what I'm already doing, we can explore the idea of me having different experiences and such. So I wasn't shut down, so that's good. But I started to spiral because he asked if it's something I would risk our relationship for. And I explained that it feels like this is what it will take for me to be happy, and I don't think it's fair to leverage my happiness against our relationship so I couldn't answer... Is that bad?

"Please give me some advice This all started about two months ago, I went about 4 days without eating to help me lose weight. That Thursday I decided to start eating again, so me and the family went to eat Mexican. I ate a small plate of fajitas (not spicy). On the way home I felt my heart rate go WAY up and started pounding really hard. Then I started to feel like my chest was tight and I couldn’t breathe properly and my hands and face began to get pins and needles. The pins and needles spread all over my body and I got this enormous pressure in my lower diaphragm. All of my joints locked up and I couldn’t move. I could speak but it was slurred. They took me to the ER and after taking several tests including a EKG a CT scan of my brain and a battery of blood tests, they concluded it was a low potassium level in my body, which triggered a panic attack. Ok. So the next Tuesday I went to my primary care doctor for a follow up to check my potassium level, and on the way I began to get that tingling and pressure in my chest again, I pulled over, got something to drink, and made it to the doctors office. Potassium came back fine. The feeling didn’t go away. All the rest of that day I felt like I couldn’t breathe. The next day I went to a minor emergency center and after even more tests on my heart lungs and veins, they concluded that I was fine and it was probably just anxiety. 3 days later. Went to the ER because the feeling still hasn’t gone away and it is getting hard to live my life. Same thing, a bunch of tests and concluded nothing. Doctor said it might be a ulcer in my stomach and put me on medication. One week later and it only got worse. I went back to the ER and they took even more extensive tests and still found nothing. I was desperate to feel better, it had been two weeks of constant suffering. I went back to my primary doctor and he ordered more tests and a copy of the results from the ER. He found what appeared to be a “hiatus hernia” in my stomach and gave me a acid reducer. It has gotten better but still hasn’t gone away. It has been almost two months since that Tuesday and I haven’t gotten even one minute of relief.

"Health anxiety when sick Hi everyone,  


I've had issues with GAD for the past 10 years, it's something I've learned a lot from, and managing it usually is not terrible difficult. In late November I came down with a cold, which in turn became a sinus infection. I've had semi-noticeable issues with my sinuses for the past two years but nothing crazy, mainly decreased sense of smell, and having a stuffy nose. During this time, I became paranoid of various fatal diseases, I had a ton of different symptoms, some that can be related to sinus stuff, some anxiety things. I've had a few ups and downs throughout the last month and a bit, at one point having almost a full week anxiety free.   


Anyways, do you guys have any recommendations for dealing with HA when you have an actual medical thing going on with it's own symptoms? I am currently paranoid about some kind of Bacterial Meningitis, which, while being rational is kind of a ridiculous fear. Going to the doctor is also a bit of a challenge, I can't get a GP in my city (In Canada) and have to use health clinics. I haven't had any of the super thorough scans, tests, etc. Which also makes me a little paranoid, even though I know it's recommended not to go down that rabbit hole. I feel like my mind gets incredibly caught up in that minuscule chance that it's something serious and my ignoring it is going to be the nail in the coffin.  


  
I also just wanted to mention that I know this is a positive experience for me, even though it's kind of miserable. I don't want to be overly negative, as I have had my good days during all of this, and I try to keep positive even when things seem incredibly bleak and dreary. ",Anxiety

I go to AA and NA meetings, but the meetings themselves don't help when I'm in depressions. It's like my body's craving the instant euphoria and dopamine if I go score. It really does help my depression temporarily and I'm able to quit fairly easily when summer comes from hypomanic energy, but I don't want to use because I know the stuff is dangerous. I'm also on meds and they help some, but don't solve it completely. I don't have this problem when the weather is good, summer hypomania replaces the need for stimulants.

How odd a feeling.During three years and a half I grew better alongside him. I started loving life in its smallest forms like insect and seeds, learnt almost everything I know about nature and started caring about myself to take better care of others.

Yet due to that covid nightmare and my failing at passing a specific exam, we have lived apart since March 2020, and he could not bear it. I have not been the best GF in a distance relationship since I have a strong sense of imagination which made me feel like he was with me in the new city I lived in, and the discrepancy between our dealing with distance cost us our story.

Bipolar (and other mental illnesses) runs genetically on my mothers side of the family (i didn’t get to know my mom she died) her sister is bipolar, but she is a very heavy meth addict, so i dont really go to her for advice or support. My dad is one of those people that don’t believe in a mental illness. My doctor has given me a low dose Seroquel/cymbalta combo and it does help 75% of the time. I also started a new job, i used to be a medical assistant, but i honestly think it made my condition so much worse. I think i always showed signs of being bipolar but never recognized them. But when i was a medical assistant i think it made me so much worse. I’m here because is anyone else’s mania miserable? When I’m manic it’s like I’m so overwhelmed with adrenaline. I cant sleep, extreme irritation/rage and horrible anxiety. How have you learned to tell the difference between how you actually truly feel, and when your being irrational? Is it possible to have a successful/stable relationship when your bipolar? Sometimes i just feel like when my feelings are so strong and intense i am such a toxic person and it’s gross, and i want to fix it.",Bipolar
"How do you get through the process of getting a job? I’m planning on doing a certain diploma you need to do at least six months of internship for. I should’ve started applying for those weeks ago but I’ve been avoiding it because I feel like I’d either end up not getting the internship or trick them into thinking I’ll be a valuable addition to their institution — which I don’t think I would be. So essentially, I’ve been doing self sabotage. 

Now, the problem is that I’ve had quite a lot of absences at school, the teachers all know about some of my mental illnesses and have suffered because of it. 

I’ll need references for the application process, I don’t have anyone else to do that other than my teachers but I feel that asking anyone to do it would be putting them in a really hard position because they don’t want to lie to an institution about me being a valuable addition when they (think they) know I’ll only mess things up. 

Honestly, I just feel like even if I end up getting an internship somehow (would be a miracle in the first place) I’d somehow find a way to burn out and mess up once again. 

If I don’t go for this diploma I’ll essentially have wasted four years of my life and I don’t think my chronically depressed self could recover from that. 

Any advice?",Personality disorder
"I did it: I gave up my old life So yeah, I did it. Or atleast I am doing it. I dont't know what will happen next. It was always a distant dream of mine to just leave everything behind. Maybe you can relate.

I quit my job and my appartment. I left my cozy first world country with a one way ticket to India. Currently I am touring Rajestan on a motorcycle. The only contact to my ""old"" life is my family. Even though I would like to cut contact I can't bring myself to do it. It would break my mothers heart.

I eat way too much (seriously the food is amazing) and get stared and begged at alot because i am a western guy. Some days I don't leave my hotel room. Other days I drive 300km on busy roads. 

You probably know this feeling. The ambivalence is killing me. I love being alone but at the same time I miss not being alone. And often I think doing this was a big mistake. The whole experience is.. meh.. 

And because I dont know where to go or what to do planning anything is impossible. Right now I have 50k in savings. But what for?

The only thing I always hear in my head is: ""Wherever you go there you are"". And atleast that's true.

"Do your episodes result in physical health problems? I've been battling bipolar for about about 8 years and just recently diagnosed and medicated in the past year and a half. Every episode I have results in my thyroid swelling up as a reaction to stress (like so big the endocrinologist gasped when he saw it), I have a whole bunch of nodules on my thyroid and now instead of the thyroid swelling up, it's the nodules that are filling with fluid and swelling up....only when I'm at the end of an episode so I know it's due to stress and the endocrinologist agrees. I've also experienced SIBO and I still do if I don't follow a strict diet, I became allergic to fragrance, coconut on skin, and Aloe Vera all out of nowhere, and my hair was falling out, this all happened when I was unmedicated, undiagnosed and extremely stressed out and my anxiety was through the roof.

"Can’t stop worrying about severe illness, cancer, surgery, and anesthesia failure - think I’m going to jinx it happening by stopping worrying about it. This is pretty superstitious, but basically it’s the fear of the fact that often things happen when you least expect them, so I’m afraid to stop expecting them to happen in order to control them into not happening.  

The other thing is that if I stop worrying about them, I get comfortable and attached to my lifestyle, and then if something happens, it’s going to be more of a letdown.  This already happened this year.  I got a very small Pilonidal Cyst (now on track to get a minor procedure to remove it), and at first I was devastated - mostly because for a while I had forgotten about the possibility of these things happening, so there was more of a shock value.

"Brain Fog/Memory Loss First time poster, still trying to figure out Reddit. My friend recommended this app once I got my diagnosis of Bipolar 2 last year. I’m 29, diagnosed at 28. 

Ever since my psychiatrist diagnosed me with Bipolar Disorder I have been suffering from serious short term memory loss. I’ve never had the most attentive brain but before I started taking my medication/had someone to talk to I remembered things too well if that makes sense. 

For example: my fiancé and I were talking last night and I pulled out my calculator and typed one number in and then all of a sudden I couldn’t remember what we were talking about 2 minutes prior. Then I asked what we were talking about and he gave me the most concerned look. I know he isn’t mad at me but worried. It’s happening so often I’ve started writing everything down. Like everything, conversations, tasks, reminders, messages I need to reply back to. It’s getting ridiculous. 

I’m currently taking Busprion 15 mg 3x a day, Hydroxyzine 50 mg 3x a day, Aripiprazole 10 mg 1x a day, and Buspar 150 mg 1x a day. 

Also, I work a very high stress job. I am a program coordinator for a low barrier homeless shelter. We deal with death, ODs, fights, assault of staff, rape allegations. It’s rough. Maybe this info will help? Idk. I just wanna know if it gets better or if I’ve given myself permanent brain damage.",Bipolar

When he told me these things, I almost immediately tied them to being possibly depressed and I have no idea what to do. I told him that I love him and understand how he might be feeling right now. I said that everything would be okay and that he can ALWAYS talk to me if he feels like hes alone and needs help.

I regularly fantasise about still hanging out with old friends I haven't spoken to in over a decade, making up memories that never happened just trying to forget that are not part of my life anymore. 

The only times I've ever been truly happy was just being ""one of the guys"" where I was invited to things and people liked having me around for some reason I couldn't quite understand. And I just pushed everyone away assuming they all secretly hated me, with absolutely evidence to support that claim. Then I spend the rest of my life thinking about them every day hoping some day they might still think of me and reach out cause I definitely am not the one to do it first. 

I haven't had a friend in years now and my life feels so empty without them, they really do fill a massive gap in my life. Feeling wanted and liked by others is the best thing I've ever felt, but it never lasts long before they see how really odd I am and a distance starts forming.

"I really dont know what to do anymore For the record i am not suicidal but i do feel like i have no way out of this. I have a concerning health condition that has been neglected for the past 6 years and gradually getting worse. I am on a slow decline in health and will do a more detailed write-up of my life and issues soon. I see death as an option to free my body of its ailments and the stupidity that caused it, had i not hurt myself i would be taking a different path but im pretty much disabled now and have tried to fight the healthcare system with no diagnosis and been labelled as crazy by every person i meet. I wont sing, dance, look or feel the same way again so for me thats not worth it. I always dreamt of doing those things but now i will never be able to do them efficiently. I dont see death as a bad thing, just terrifying and really hard to process and a way to get out of a shitty life, i would rather die than be in a lot of situations really because we all die anyway i dont really want to suffer for too long. And the world doesnt care because it will just keep spinning. so there arent any negative feelings just logical and impartial situation which i accept. Everyone will die too so rather sooner than later. Otherwise I would have a degree in performing arts or music by now and would be performing and doing things with my life. Sadly that isnt the case and am stuck with an illness that isn't getting better.

My face is swollen and so is my body, my wounds won't heal, I can't exercise and feel fatigued every day, my veins bulge and I have extremely pale skin, my eyes are also bulging(my brother pointed this out to me and I thought I was the only one who thought this), my teeth are cracking and my gums are pale, numbness in every single part of my body, blood pools, anhedonia, and dissociation, impaired memory and I can't even count or decide what to eat, have to double check my spelling and memory and even then I forget, bathroom struggles, insomnia, weak bones, head feels full and swollen, fingernails have started to club believe it or not, hair and nails don't grow, blue extremities and struggling to breathe, cant hold head up and body feels very heavy to carry, sharp pains around my body aching pains, blurred vision and double vision, i can't even walk anymore and my ligaments crack all the time. pre 2017 this would not have been the case because i injured myself very severly and do not realise the damage i have done. doctors are saying nothings wrong with me but thats not true, the problems have built up over time which i suspect is a problem with my vascular system but getting seen in the UK is very hard. i have also bought a healthcare plan which is not private health insurance but all that i can afford(£11 monthly). The extent of damage it has done to me made me realize that i may not ever be normal again IF i ever get treated that is, and so i feel like my only option is to die. I know some people say that people who are crippled and have disabilities can have long satisfying lives but that is not the life for me, especially considering there was nothing wrong with me before. i always dream to be that way again but i know i won't get that anymore and i wont be happy at all, the damage it has done to me probably affected my brain to the point where i dont think it will ever recover, or my heart, or my bones, or my optic nerves so i don't think it's worth living if I have long-lasting complications.

And also the cause was self-harm, I know it sounds silly but it could have been prevented. I was mentally ill and the things I did weren't normal, looking back at it now and it's all my parent's fault, they convoluted my idea of normal since I was a little kid. I never got the help i needed not even for my selective mutism and now I'm screwed for good. I'm no good anymore and worthless, I can't even make or remember memories and this isn't the depression speaking since I had an urge to fix my life and get back on track. Now I have a wound that will never heal. My parents were extremely toxic and detrimental since my youth, my only fantasies were ones of running away. I don't have much contact with them and am stuck in the house with them. In 2017 I self-harmed so bad my left side went number and weaker and I have been that way ever since. Now it's caused so many problems because of something pressing on my vascular system causing harm to my entire body, but I am told there is nothing wrong with me, even by the most toxic people of all (my parents) they got so sick of me trying to reach out for help, my father shouted at me and sent me into a burst of tears, I choked on my tea but I persisted and called the doctor and asked for an appointment, he took me to the docs but I feel like I'm in a losing game. I don't really have any positive options anymore and am in so much pain 24/7. I've lost my sight somewhat, hearing, function, mobility, emotions, and cognition and am basically becoming a vegetable. Even if I do get treated it will be too late as the damage has left permanent wounds. I've shown someone pics before and they have admitted its pretty messed up what I have been through. I am struggling for answers but at the least, I can get a diagnosis just so I can shove it in people's faces and prove them wrong. But other than that I just don't know what to do with my life anymore. I got tired from making this post I took a few breaks and am still lethargic.

My doctor that i recently visited also noticed that i was looking a bit pale so for me thats been a relief, he was quite attentive and offered to give me a blood test which is next month so i have to struggle to next month. He weighed me(im 48kg now) and we talked about my symptoms and I did mention to him it has to do with my vascular system, it's now a test of time to see what will happen.

"Sorry in advance if some sentences do not make any sense as I am not a native speaker. Most of my english comes from memes and series. I am 25 years old male, big loser with no education and living in a shit hole. I have been depressed since I have been concious, and the pain has been gradually increasing to a point that I feel like I cannot take it anymore. My father was not present when I was a kid, and because my mom had to take care of me alone, she overworked herself so she could sustain her kid. The absence of my father and mother in my life hurted me a lot, and while I despise my father for leaving my mom when she was pregnant, I can totally understand why she was absent and trying to give me a decent life to her best efforts. I was physically abused by my babysitter on a daily basis. It was very hard for me to articulate to my mom what she was doing, and this ended when a friend of my family witnessed what she was doing to me one day. After that, I started living alone in our house because my mom could not trust anyone else to take care of me (this was when I was 9 yo). At my 11 years of age, I was sexually abuse by a woman that was 4 years older than me. The experience was very traumatic and sex has always been very difficult since then. All of my romantic relationships have ended in abandonment from my partner, and I wonder if the sexual abuse that I suffered earlier has to do with that. I deserted my undergrad (Mechatronics) because I was scared of failing again in life, and running always seemed easier and safer (I deeply regret this now that I am older, but it is too late to go back). Now I am stuck in a third world country with a very high crime rate and extreme poverty, with no education, no good jobs prospects, nothing. I was very close to end my life a few days ago, but my current girlfriend decided to call me randomly and I broke down into tears and told her everything, and she convinced me to not do it. I have never tried suicide before, but that day I was completely commited to end my life violently and for good. My current relationship is long distance. she is in another country, with an ok job and is on her way to become a permanent resident. Because of my lack of education and preparation, it is almost impossible for me to go to where she is. We met when we were younger in the current country that I live in, and we had a relationship but she left me for reasons that I did not know back then, and then we reconnected few months ago and we are together again (yea, I know that this was a very bad decision). I have decided that I am going to ilegally inmigrate to a first world country and gamble my life there. My options are limited and I fucking hate life so why not? This was a decision I made before I got into this relationship, but now that I am compromised with someone, and realised that there is no way in hell we could be together because she would have to leave everything just to live together with a good for nothing. It really sounds ridiculous. She says that she is deeply in love with me, and would do anything to be together. I feel like what is going to happen is that she is going to realise that she had to sacrifice a lot for an unknown future with someone that is a loser and will end up hating me. I also deeply love her, and I do not think I could forgive myself ever. I want to end my life. I do not think I can fix my situation, and even so, the temptation of killing myself will ever go away. I am so sorry for my mother that had a very rough life, and it seems that I am about to just make it more miserable for her. I hope that my mother, girlfriend and friends could forgive me, but maybe that is asking for too much. I definitely do not deserve any of that. Thank you for reading my story. Am at my wits' end.

I've heard everyone talk about increased appetite but since I've started taking it 3 times a day I've just been eating a small breakfast and a small dinner because I'm just not hungry... This isn't a problem, because I am overweight and could stand to lose a couple pounds, but it's just weird that most medications I've been on have made me VORACIOUSLY hungry. Seroquel, for example, made me the beast of the kitchen. I would eat EVERYTHING. 

Another thing I've noticed, that might play into my loss of appetite, is that everything tastes awful. Things I used to love now are kind of just ""meh."" 

I'm not necessarily complaining, just wondering if any other current or previous Depakote users have felt this way?",Bipolar
"I saw someone I barely know sneakily taking a pic of me while in auditorium I'm currently in uni (not doing well) and today I decided to show up to a lecture, a girl from my dorm who takes the same classes as me sat in front of me. I saw her subtly taking a pic where I was in the background and circle my face out on it (to put the attention on me) in Snapchat. 

I have been avoiding all dorm activities and I know everyone else have become a tight group of friends while I have been too scared to go out there and get out of my dorm room to interact with anyone for the entire semester. 

When I think about it, it makes perfect sense that people find me weird and make fun of me. It's being the odd one out, the asocial guy who doesn't show his face. I mean I don't even know the names of the people in my hallway. 

I can understand why they would talk about my strangness or see me as weird, even be kind of disgusted by me. I am extremely akward, I lack social skills, I am anxious and get panic attacks (emotional flashbacks) when around people. I have no healthy boundaries and do not know who I am as a person (have no consistent sense of self). To cope with all this I avoid all situations in which people could reject me or shame me for my insecurities, lack of social skills etc. 

By avoiding situations, I am trying to avoid getting rejected or ridiculed, and deep down I know it's only normal to be frowned upon for being different or weird (think about the fact that you can't help but look at someone who walks weird because of arthritis, or when you come accros a homeless man lying on the side of the street). Your attention either gets caught or you try to consciously ignore it.

Somehow I was still somewhat believing that I could fool the people in my dorm and hope they won't think of me as flawed, insecure, weird, antisocial, a loner etc. After seeing that I am indeed most likely a subject of ridicule, mockery, disgust etc to the people in my dorm I can fully drop my delusion.

I have CPTSD and I developped my avoidance because of childhood emotional neglect/abandonment and abuse by my narc mother. My brain is wired differently than the average person with healthy and good enough parents. I didn't have secure attachments in childhood and I am for that reason developmentally arrested. 

The people in my dorm don't know me and don't know about my trauma or CPTSD. They are doing what humans do, pointing out the weirdness, the odd one out, the undesirable. 

It triggers people when they are confronted by something they don't understand or find weird, it's normal, they have their own insecurities and issues and can project all of that on the black sheep, on the odd one out. 

If I had healthy parents, good enough social skills and a fully developped and trauma free brain I would probably do the same when I encountered a weird person, heck I even have judged many people for being strange, undesirable or weird myself and thought I was superior to them.",Personality disorder
"Decrease stress by ADDING a hormetic stressor into your life. One of the best ways to decrease how much total stress you experience is by adding good forms of stress (short and moderate) called hormetic stressors.  Cold water is a prototypical hormetic stressor.  It releases stress hormones like adrenaline and noradrenaline but it is short and not extreme.   

We just launched an app that provides guided cold showers to make it easy for you to do them.  It is led by a Master Chief Navy SEAL.  We teach you a set of mental tools around tactical breathwort, body relaxation, self talk, etc.  These tools not only make cold showers easier but they also help you handle stress more generally.    

In fact, the best way to train yourself to handle stress better is to systematically stress yourself and then practice these tools while stressed.  If you do that, these tools will become reflexive any time your body generates stress hormones.

"Is it anxiety and over thinking? Or is it intuition? How to know the difference? My partner has lied to me in the past and now anything that is remotely close to that topic makes me think he’s lying. And then I spiral and think I have to check his phone, then I think he deleted messages, then I need to check his Apple Watch, and then I think he may have used another form of contact and I start to feel like maybe I’m being illogical and crossing the line. In the moment, I feel like nothing can give me relief except for finding solid “proof.” 

I’m not proud of this behavior. I recently started therapy for my overall anxiety. Unfortunately it is hard to afford to have sessions often enough. 

Context: 
He lied 1.5 years ago about something relating to a female coworker it was not infidelity. After lying, he was able to “prove” he was telling the truth. I feel 99% confident about it. Since then, he lied about about small things like not playing video games while on the phone. Idk I don’t want to damage my relationship with this but I also don’t want to be lied to again and turn a blind eye. 


So how can I know if I am acting because of anxiety and overthinking opposed to following intuition and following my gut. My intuition is how I caught his initial lie.",Anxiety

"I’m so lost I have struggled with depression for as long as I can remember. Even when I was young, I wasn’t really happy. Anyway, I was diagnosed in my early twenties. I have learned how to live with depression, how to alleviate it etc. 
I haven’t really been to therapy a lot, for several reasons. Lately, I don’t have the energy for most things. I can barely make it through the day. I have deadlines and things to do and I really really want to get out of this vicious cycle and get better. But every now and then, I completely lose hope. I don’t really want to die, because despite everything I maintain my optimism that things can and will change. 
But in the meantime… how am I supposed to function to get there? Change only happens with actions. I don’t have the energy. I’ve lost all motivation. 

My main problem these days is: what’s the point? I see what’s going on in the world and everything is going to shit. People are fake as fuck. The only things that matter to society are extremely superficial. I don’t understand how people function in this society. 

It’s probably also helpful to mention that my home life is an epic disaster. I had to move in with my parents because I don’t work currently (thank you depression) and for the past year and a half, they have been in a pre-separation mode that they won’t conclude. I think that both of them are narcissists who ultimately only care about themselves. My mom holds me responsible for her marriage and she has played the victim her whole life. My dad is a narcissistic liar who won’t deal with the truth. My siblings are pretty toxic and I am the one that they all depend on for emotional support. The thing, no one is really there for me. 

Anyway. This was a rant I needed to let out because I don’t really have anyone to vent to. I don’t want to burden my boyfriend with my depression, he doesn’t deal well with it. I don’t want to tell my friend about this because they have their own problems and we barely ever get to talk (they all live abroad). I rarely meet people who understand me.

"Vivid dream of psychotic break I've never had a dream like last night's before and I sincerely expected I would be on my way to the hospital when I woke up.  In the dream, I was hallucinating and detaching so vividly it seemed like a real episode and not a dream.  I mean, I know dreams have natural tendencies to be weird and surreal, so to say ""I dreamt of hallucinating"" doesn't do justice to how it felt.

"How to not hurt peoples feelings I think I’m doing better at socializing than before but after a big socialization day I get so worn out from all the effort it takes that I need a recovery day where I literally don’t interact with anyone or else I start shutting down. 

However society does not work on my schedule and so obviously I can’t always have a recovery. When I’m socially overwhelmed I tend to give short answers and seem super aloof, disinterested, monotone etc. sometimes people take this personally even though it has nothing to do with them, I’m just worn out.

Usually with strangers it doesn’t matter that much because I’ll never meet them again, but with my friends or partner it can be hard. They obviously care about me and start asking, “are you mad at me? Am I annoying? Etc.” and that kind of stuff is really irritating because it requires some level of delicacy by saying “you as a person are not annoying, but I’m just really irritated right now for reasons other than you, and you are exacerbating it. But it is not your fault and there’s no reason you would’ve known this” Like I wish I could just say that but literally nothing comes out of my mouth. I can’t manage anything other than a tiny whimper of a “no…” because I at least want to preserve their feelings. 

My partner especially gets insecure and frequently asks me “are you mad at me, do you hate me, am I annoying” somewhat in jest but also to an extent it’s a reflection of real insecurities I know she has told me about. I can’t handle navigating those questions when I’m socially overstimulated but I don’t want to make her insecure worse either.

"How did you get a therapist and/or an official diagnosis? I've decided to finally take action and try and get some kind of diagnosis so I'm not just relying on my internal monologue or the internet to deal with this thing.

I tried therapy once in the past with a therapist who came highly recommended and it just didn't go great. After one too many ""what's the worst that could actually happen?"" questions, I just really felt like they didn't understand. This was before I had the term AVPD to explain.

My question is this: How did you go about working with someone who actually understands the problem?

My guess is I'm being a bit too in-my-head about this, but I just don't want to show up to a therapist like a hypochondriac who plugged their symptoms into WebMD and now is 100% sure of their condition. But I also get the impression AVPD isn't as common as some other personality disorders, so I want to find someone who will at least have familiarity with it. But nothing shows up when I search for therapists who specialize in it directly. Are there other umbrella terms that help when finding a therapist? Should I just focus on a depression/anxiety doc or maybe one who works with other PDs like BPD?

"Journaling Advice I've been journaling as a routine for a while now and I feel I need a little more structure.  My typical entry is food, caffeine, nicotine, water, exercise, sleep, and how I feel.

For instance, I can have entries that range from ""feeling scattered"", ""feeling lost"", ""feeling confused"".  Well really this is me saying I am confused.  So I was thinking of focusing on Robert Plutchik's theory of 8 basic emotions and sort of seeing how that works for a while.

"Tingling left chin and other parts - should I be concerned? Hi guys,

So straight into it - I was stressing (panic attack probably) about my brother’s health (He got Leukaemia a few years ago) because I had thought it had came back. Also been pretty depressed thinking about in the past 2 months (never knew how bad it was). 

Now when I was worried about this, I felt a tingling sensation on my left chin. This was around two weeks.  Maybe 4 times or so this has happened, however recently it feels like it has been more recurring (not sure if focusing on it has to do with it). I was super stressed thinking I’ve got cancer so I got my CBC, which there was no issue with.

Now I went to the dentist today and told him about the tingling. He said to me to get an x-ray and he really wasn’t sure why it was like that. My wisdom teeth had came through and he was pretty stern on me getting it checked. That scared me a decent amount, he said that x-ray will show what the problem is.


Since this ordeal and getting the all clear after the CBC, I will get random tingling throughout my body for a few seconds in small sports it goes away. (As soon as I move my limb or finger, they go away) I’ve also been a bitch more itchy of late and get the occasional sharp pains.


However apart from this I’ve been fine (no other symptoms) Eating a lot, lots of energy, no headaches, not feeling tired, no blood in stool and no night sweats. I’m just concerned what this could be. Should I be concerned? 

Thanks guys love you all!",Anxiety
"To keep a long story short :August 2020 : I met a girl who had a long distance relationship. We kept dating because we like each other.November 2020 : I was diagnosed with burnout/depressionDecember 2020 : she breaks up with her long distance relationship.February 2021: we tried to have sex but I had sexual dysfunction due to my burnout. She told me she was ""turned off"" because of it. She started to became distant and told me it was for other reasons than sexual dysfunction. I kept reaching to her because I was totally addict.June 2021 : we kept dating during all this time. after months of arguments (me asking her why she was acting distant) she broke up with me and tells me she was dating a new guy since 3 weeks ago.2 days ago I unfollowed her on social medias to help myself moving on. She was not watching my stories anymore anyway. I begged her to stay with me for a month. The day after I unfollowed her she unfollowed all my friends and asked her sister to unfollow me too. Why did she did this ? How did her noticed so rapidly that I unfollowed her ? Was she still looking at my account ?Do I have any chance to win her back after all this ? Thanks ! Help ! Will she come back ? :(",Depression
"i do not know what to do anymore, i really do not. its not like things have gotten worse or anything, its just the same suffering like always. it is just that i am close to my breaking point i cannot take it anymore. everyday i just wish i could die. i tried slitting my wrists (it failed) and jumping off (also failed, i was too much of a coward to do it). my parents know that i slit my wrists and they were angry about it. i suppose they did not know how to react. i asked them to bring me to a mental hospital/psych ward but they shouted at me and told me that it was not serious and that there is nothing wrong with me. do not get me wrong this is not about my parents they are only trying to help but i really do not know how much longer i can wait. my dad told me to leave things to him and to just focus on my studies/normal everyday stuff but firstly, he is very busy with his work. secondly i do not know how much longer i can take it and just sit down and wait i need to die. my parents do not understand that i cannot function like a normal human being i just cannot. everytime someone talks to me or asks me a question it takes me so long to process it and i end up stuttering. i do not know what to say when i call the suicide hotline and i do not know what they will do. i would like them to bring me to the mental hospital/psych ward but i do not know how and i do not know how i will explain it to my parents. someone pls help thanksps: my parents are really nice I am just saying that their way of helping me is making me worse/not doing anything at all what to say to the suicide hotline",Suicidal
"I met someone on Hinge about eight months ago and we got along instantly which is extremely rare for me. We could not meet in person at the time due to lockdown restrictions. It started like any online dating relationship starts, with flirting and asking questions and getting to know one another. All of a sudden he stopped showing interest. That really affected my already low self-esteem and I tried my best to talk to him and figure out why he lost interest. I came across as cold and scary, he became very defensive, it got quite bad and I had quite a severe panic attack that took five propanolol to sort out. I blamed myself and he reluctantly came back, he would be even colder and more distant now. No more good mornings or how are yous, no flirting, no questions, nothing. Just very short superficial talks about current events or interests. I tried to ask him in a more direct way why he was behaving like that and it resulted in him ignoring me. I gave up and deleted him off all social media (except the one we used for messaging) and moved on with my life. Two months later he messages me saying how much he misses me and wants to rectify things. Nobody has ever come back for me, it meant a lot. We start talking again, nothing gets rectified he just repeats himself whilst ignoring and not apologizing for how he behaved. But I am just happy he is back so I let it be. We finally meet and it goes somewhat well, he does not flirt but he seems interested again. Fast forward to our 5th date and we sleep together. Afterwards he just goes back to being distant despite always being online. It makes me extremely overwhelmed and I go talk to him. I am ignored until he replies about how he cannot take it anymore and how it is not his fault work was busy. I mentioned how affection or at least signs of interest are and he was having none of it. Ultimately I blamed myself and explained my current family situation as it also affects me to maybe make him understand that I just really needed some support and he ignored me for days. I would avoid messaging him but I would always see him online. I asked him for closure as I did not know what do he replied instantly, said it was a shame as we were so compatible and that if I wanted we could still be friends. When I replied that if we both tried it could work, he ignored me again. The day after I went for a day out on the beach and saw a little stall that does clam chowder which I have never tried before meeting him and it is one of his fav foods, when I got home I messaged him saying that I wanted to take him there to show him something even if just as friends. He ignored me again. The day afterwards (which was yesterday) I had a job interview. I have been trying really hard these past years to finally have my own life. I have been through therapy, medication and regularly study and follow well-being advice. Currently, I live with my mom - who has her own set of mental health problems lately she is been well but at times she becomes awful towards me. Especially if I show emotions, the worst ones are if I cry or seem angry (even if I am not, if she thinks I am then that is an invitation to start a fight) - and my cat - who is dying of lymphoma. I am an immigrant so I do not have many friends here. Most of my friends are from work but lately everybody is too busy for me. So this job interview meant a lot. If I get this, I may very well be able to afford to live in my own place. In the hype of the interview, I made a decision to move on and have a fresh start. New job, then new house, new life. And I was tired of feeling so overwhelmed and weighed down by everything and now being given false hope. So I messaged a final time, stating this could have all been sorted within a day. How it is impossible to form any relationship with someone who simply is not there. I then deleted him off the messaging app we use and his number. He has not attempted to communicate but it is not as if I am expecting it. I do not think I am wrong. I think that if he wanted to this could work. What affects me is why is it that nobody ever wants to at least try to make it work? I am willing to compromise, I have always hyped him up and showed him that he matter to me. Every morning I would wish him a good morning despite knowing I would not receive one back, the same would happen at night. So what is it about me that so damn disgusting that does not even deserve a good morning? I am afraid to cry under my own roof. I have absolutely nobody in this world and the only creature on this planet that somehow loves me is going to die soon. I cannot trust anyone because of the amount of times I have been bullied, rejected, belittled, used, harmed. I have attempted suicide twice before so I know this third time I would not fail, plus three times the charm. The only thing keeping me here is waiting to hear back from the interview and how bitterly disappointing it is that now, after my entire life spent trying to overcome trauma and abuse, when I am finally getting where I want, someone appears and completely kills any crumb of love I had for myself just by not bothering to be there. After a half-ghosted ""relationship"" ended I have been thinking about suicide for the past days",Suicidal

"I am curious if other people are the same as me, or if I am just mentally insane. I will start. I am suicidal. So what do I want? It is pretty obvious. I WANT to fucking die. The truth is, I do not want you telling me not to get what I want. I do not want to hear you telling me ""Things will get better."", because you do not know that. I do not want to hear you deny the bad things I said about myself and list out what YOU think are good things about me, because you really do not know a damn thing about me. All I want to hear from you is that you heard me, and that it is OKAY for me to die. Alright, maybe the second part is a bit tough. I am pretty sure it is against the rule, and nobody is going to be crazy enough to say that to a suicidal person. It certainly not going to help them get better. However, that is honestly how I feel. I just want someone to tell me it is okay for me to escape this hellhole, instead of continuing to endure this suffering. I just cannot do it anymore.Now, what about you all? I want to know what you want to hear from people. Maybe, this will help lessen those generic anti-suicide responds. I know people are tired of hearing it, myself included. I also would like to thank people who try to help others. I know it is tough, since you do not know what the right things to say. Sometime, there is just no right things to say. And that is okay.

"Help me please. Insomnia from 1 year. It feels like dying everyday Hello everybody. I am facing insomnia from the past one year. I got covid one year before. I was in hospital and at that time every few hours somebody is dying in front of me. I got so scared and anxiety hit me so hard that my mouth remains dry, my hands were shaking, my heartbeat doubles. I feels like i am going to die and this thought didn't let me sleep for 20 days straight in a row. Covid gone but now i got insomnia. I went to bed but didn't get even a single minute of sleep. I got so frustrated, the days was like hell, it was like somebody just take my soul out of body, i don't want to live anymore. Tried melatonin, Vitamin B6 Tablet, Got sunlight daily, nothing works. Then I consult to a doctor. She prescribed me to take clonazepam .25mg for 4 weeks and along to take mirtazapine 7.5mg. Then as per doctors suggestion i stopped taking clonazepam after 4 weeks and continued to take mirtazapine 7.5 mg. It was good for 8 months. I started exercise 30mins daily. Walk for 5 km daily. Now Few days before my body again started to facing insomnia( there is no stress, the insomnia comes automatically). In 10 days duration my sleep got reduced to 1 hour per day and now after 10 days i got no sleep not even a single minute.

"Tired of mania and I just want it to stop I’ve been in a mixed episodes I guess since around December with about a month of hypomania preceding it. Right now I feel stable but I’m all over the place. I was switched from latuda to vraylar in December, and my doctor added 1 mg klonopin up to 2x a day and 100 mg trazodone. My meds I’m still on, and was on before is 500mg depakote 3x a day, lexapro 5 mg, and temazepam 30 mg. So I’m on a lot of meds and I was putting a lot of faith into trying this vraylar since it’s supposed to treat mixed episodes, and some of my symptoms have dissipated or gone away like I’m not as physically and mentally agitated, and my thoughts have slowed a bit, but I’m still having these outbursts of rage where I feel completely out of control and aggressive, and then I feel shame and embarrassment because I have no impulse control when, and leading up to these outbursts, and before. I had to move back home with my mom a couple weeks ago because I quit/was sort of pushed out of my job in December because my episode was escalating and I couldn’t manage my caseload. My boss was a social worker and said she’d call me in January to see if I was ready to come back to work and she never did so I just figure that my job I’ve built my career around is now just obsolete because of my circumstances for leaving. I blew all my savings in December and January by going on a trip to Vegas and then other stupid shit. 

I’m not hearing things anymore like I was, but my thoughts are disorganized and I’m not sure if my thinking is accurate. I ruined most of my relationships with people within a few weeks in December, so I’ve been isolating myself from the people I do know, but I still keep putting myself in not-so-ideal circumstances with people I don’t really know or really care to be around if it weren’t for the impulse to do some of these things. I don’t know why I can’t control this. The klonopin and trazodone aren’t cutting it for sleep. I’m supposed to use the klonopin and temazepam and trazodone together, but apparently there’s been a shortage of temazepam so I haven’t been able to fill that since early December.

My therapist and psychiatrist have been trying to keep me out of the hospital, but I’m starting to feel crappy and just kind of weak feeling. I cry nearly everyday, which is very abnormal for me, and I feel like I can’t eat so my body’s starting to feel like shit. 

My therapist brought up the prospect of ECT today. I’m 25 and the thought that I’m already having to escalate to even having that kind of conversation was terrifying to me. I know it has advanced over the years, but it’s still kind of scary. She also said if I don’t seem better next week she’s probably going to hospitalize me. I’m so exhausted from it all and tired of going several nights with no sleep that I don’t care anymore, but I think that means I probably don’t need to go then. I also read relapses happen within a year for most people even with successful ECT treatments. I’m just feeling so worthless.

Has anyone had ECT treatments? Did it actually help? Or just any advice in general? 

Thanks ",Bipolar

"I’m new I’m very recently diagnosed (in conjunction w ASD). I’m just very scared of my head; I’m scared of the way my brain makes me think and I am scared of how little control I have over it. Ive no idea what world I’ve entered into, mostly because I don’t understand much yet, despite wanting to. I’ve studied psychology at university before dropping out (multiple times), and it’s so easy to look at things on the outside and understand them, but to look introspectively is so difficult. It’s difficult to analyse the thoughts I should and shouldn’t listen to. It’s difficult to place or recognise moments of irritability, excitement, etc. Sometimes I’m panicking without even knowing I’m panicking or why. Im just very much in a state of barely knowing what’s going on in my head until the aftermath, unless it’s depressive thoughts, those are pretty easy to figure out, and by far the most common for me. People near me just say I shouldn’t think that way, but it’s hard explaining why I feel I have no control over how I genuinely feel… if that makes sense.

"I accidentally wore white to a wedding and can't stop shame-spiraling -- Self-forgiveness with anxiety Yesterday I attended my boyfriend's cousin's wedding and wore a short cream-colored dress with a black pattern. The color literally did not occur to me when I got dressed. I picked it because I felt bloated and it was flowy, and that's as far as my brain got.

At the reception, my boyfriend's mom spilled red wine on my dress. As I tried to dab out the stain, I caught myself saying ""see, this is why I never wear white""--and then it hit me. I spiraled into an anxiety attack and left the reception to go back to my hotel to change. I felt like such an asshole, such an idiot, and I still can't shake that feeling.

I sat in the second-to-last row at the ceremony, at the very end of the row away from the aisle -- thank God. It was a casual wedding. People were there in jeans. No one said anything to me. And it was genuinely an accident. A very stupid accident. But it was also my first time meeting my boyfriend's extended family, and I'm now convinced they all hate me. I can't think about anything else. I feel like such a fuckup, like I'm a bad person.

Logically, I know it's not the end of the world. I know if THAT was my biggest asshole move in recent memory, I'm doing OK. But I don't FEEL any of that. Self-forgiveness seems truly impossible with anxiety sometimes.",Anxiety
"The paranoia is killing me I feel so isolated and afraid. Things are turning, crumbling. I feel like I can't turn to anyone. My psychologist and doctor understand but damn the nights are so long, and in the day, I have to be around so many people I can't tell what's going on for me. Some professionals even don't understand me unless they know me very well. I'm a serial masker and even when I'm wanting to throw a chair through a window I'll just casually say ""I'm raging right now"" and they don't take notice lol. So some professionals don't take notice and others say things like ""I'm very alarmed"" at my behaviour. I just can't be that person I used to be anymore; exploding rage and emotion. Luckily a have professionals that see the signs clearly but talking to others can make me feel invisible.

I feel like everyone in society, the world around me, online, is watching everything I'm saying and doing, even people in cars or shop assistants. Which I know sounds ridiculous, but I feel like I can't move a muscle or say a thing, it's constant. It's even hard to post here.

It was fun with the spiritual and sensual bliss but now it's just hell. I made the mistake of having a nap before midnight and I won't sleep tonight. I got an exam today, I'll see my nurse thankfully, then my therapist, but right now I just see this long stretch of night ahead of me. The house is so quiet, I'm worried I'll see ghosts if I leave my room lol. I just feel so very alone.

College helped so much, they're very supportive there, my classmates are amazing but it's getting confusing for me there, too. My mouth is starting to get me in trouble. I feel like my world is getting smaller section by section. 

My psychologist said it was ok for me to go to a Buddhist centre for a few days as long as I don't drive there, as long as I stick to grounding meditation rather than the transendental stuff lol. So maybe that will help me a lot.

I don't even know what this post is about. It's just all crumbling down, now. I might try to switch channels in my brain rather than hyperfocusing on my phone. Have something to eat and drink. Maybe try sleep again.

I'm focusing so inwardly; thoughts, feelings, etc. I need to get out of my head and into my body. I try to do the mindfulness 5 things but I'm too paranoid about ghosts right now. I wanna listen to my headphones but can't for the same reason. I think I'm literally too afraid to leave my bed or do anything but type, and too paranoid to ring a hotline. I'm dreading 3 am but hopefully I will be asleep by then.

I dunno, maybe this post is an ask for someone out there to make me feel like I'm not one alien on an Earth full of humans lol. Either way I just gotta get it off my chest.",Bipolar

"University Degree Stress Hello I'm currently in my third year of university. Since the start I have been very stressed and at times had bad thoughts come into my head.

"I am super stressed because my reputation at work has taken a huge hit and it's affecting my work I graduated with a masters degree and joined my place of work exactly a year ago. This is the first job of my life and that made it little difficult for me to get a hang of the corporate life. 
However, since I have a master's degree, the expectations were high. 

I made a lot of mistakes last year, one of which was that I didn't pursue good development work aggressively. Whenever a senior told me that they can not trust me with development work right now, I accepted it and hoped that they will see my efforts. 
The concerns of my senior was that I won't be able to understand development task by myself and even if someone explained it to me, I won't complete it before deadline because of my lack of skills. 

And because of this, a perception has been created in everyone's mind that I miss deadlines and that I only complete basic tasks. 

Since start of 2022, I have been trying my best to change the perception. I am taking on more tasks as well as completing them on time. However, if I make a single mistake, the views of my senior and manager changes to me being undependable. 

I am being micromanaged because no one trusts me that I can complete the work on time. 

And that's not it. I have also been given a warning of being put on improvement required. 

I am very very stressed. I don't know how things have gone so wrong in just 1 year. I am trying very hard to prove myself, but all my efforts are going to waste.

"On the Here and Now Looking out at a beautiful spring day I find myself buried in anxiety.  Thoughts crash into my mind

“*I’ve lost weight recently, what if it’s the beginning of the end”*

*“I feel dizzy, oh god there’s something wrong I know it”*

*“What if I stop looking and miss an important symptom?”*

&amp;#x200B;

I am so fucking tired of this.  We spend so much of our day worrying about the future or ruminating on our past.  But we have *only* now.  Our consious mind doesn’t inhabit the future or the past, it inhabits this very moment.  Right. Now.  

And right now I don’t want to feel anxious.  Don’t get me wrong, I don’t want to feel anxious ever but I can only change that *right now*.  The best part?  The more I change that right now, the easier it will be to change that for future me.  

&amp;#x200B;

So starting right now I’m going to:

1. **STOP GOOGLING (and body checks).**  My doctor once told me I have “googleitis” and the best and only cure was to just stop.  Helpful advice there.    
Obviously go to your doctor if you're worried about something, and by all means, get a second opinion if you're still concerned.  Beyond that, leave it to the professionals to diagnose.  
2. **Stop seeking reassurance for every symptom.**  I know what people are going to say to me.  “You’re fine”, “Statistically that only has a 0.00001% chance”, “breathe deeply”.  I can do this for myself.  I can be kind and firm with my own mind.  
3. **Stop asking “what if”**.  Things can and will happen.  Worrying about the future will never help.  We can only live our best lives now, and take life as it comes.
4. **Actually acknowledge statistics.**  Next time I feel a symptom I’m going to ask myself “what’s the most likely cause?”  Pretty much any symptom can be better attributed to harmless things like lack of sleep, too much coffee, too much anxious thinking, and so on.
5. **Recognize and challenge maladaptive thought patterns.** The more I think in anxious ways, the more my brain will automatically go back to those patterns.  Time to see those thoughts for what they are: unrealistic beliefs and fears.  

&amp;#x200B;

I know anxiety is going to get worse at the start, but I can handle that.

I can do this.  So can you.  ",Anxiety

Perhaps I should find something… as simple as it may be…something I can turn into cohesion. I guess it is as good a time as ever to speak about feelings… my feelings, nonetheless.

How does anxiety feel? I know we’ve all been there. Any E-scripture on anxiety that you might stumble upon will say as much, but, baring mental health professionals, I don’t think that those of us that enunciate the word “anxiety” with statistical-outlier levels of frequency have the same notion of the concept than those whose usage falls into the mean. What I mean by that, of course, is that those of us afflicted by pathological levels of anxiety feel it in a quantitively and qualitatively different way. I guess that’s why we get diagnosed… catalogued as distinct by the authorities that oversee defining this part of society. We’re a messy bunch. It reflects in all facets of my life.

I have messy hair, messy eyes, my room is messy my thoughts are scattered (and messy!), I can’t make a decision for the love of myself; the short version: I don’t work. I mean that both literally and figuratively, whatever that means! (think about it! What does the verb “to work” mean in a literal way? Is it having a job? But that’s having a job, we call it work because you do motions in a job, but we call the motions “work”, because “work” is the act of physical exertion right? I don’t know, this is literal garbage that I’m talking right now (talking/writing “garbage” can’t literally be literal (I think I just transferred a calque from Spanish, too long to get into this tangent))). I can’t hold a normal job; I can’t hold my emotions most of the times. Today some guy at the mall forgot my coffee, and I felt like as if I’ve murdered someone. I mean, I’ve never killed anyone -and I hope I never do such a heinous thing-, but you know that feeling you get in your chin, your chest and neck that pushes you down? The one you get when something bad, really bad is about to happen? I was feeling that over a coffee man. I stared the guy directly in the eye, not with the best of intentions. I was literally offended, but I don’t feel that it was in a normal way. How do I know that? Cause I didn’t use to be like that. Emotions, to me, seem to work now like to a BPD patient (perhaps I have BPD traits?). How do emotions work for BPD patients? Simple! Take an emotion X and then square it. A more detailed example: anger(in BPD afflicted individual) = anger\^2. Or perhaps it’s even a cubical function: i.e., anger\^3 (I don’t even remember if cube is exponential 3). Anxiety is writing parenthesis excusing yourself of mistakes in your personal journal entries that no one else will ever fucking read.

Anxiety is looking at your neighbor and running away inside your home for no reason. Anxiety is feeling gutted for dreaming about the people that made you the happiest you’ve been in ages. Anxiety is snapping at those who love you, because you can’t love yourself and everything has a bitter taste to shit. Anxiety is wanting to die, looking at places where you could hang yourself, feeling relief at the thought of no longer breathing, imagining a knife to the throat, thinking about swerving into traffic, travelling, and not feeling anything, kissing someone you’re deeply into and not feeling anything, doubting everything you do, every single cell in your body being inadequate. Anxiety is knowing at a scientific level that something is wrong, but still suffering through it. Anxiety is abusing drugs, anxiety is depression, anxiety is the antithesis of life, of enjoyment, of love and all that’s good. This is “anxiety”, as this is obviously a corrupted, poisonous version of a feeling that’s supposed to help us survive: i.e., anxiety. “Anxiety” turns a survival tool against those who are trying to survive.

"Different Muscle Spasm Sensation While trying to go to sleep last night, I noticed a different type of muscle twitch/spasm in my thigh. I say it's different because any other time I felt a spasm I can see the muscle twitch. It's usually happened in my shoulder/upper arm in past. This one is in my thigh but it feels more like a cellphone vibration that's been coming and going intermittently. I'm a fairly active, muscular guy who's been focusing on running alot. In the past, when I neglect the gym for a few days I've noticed these things happen.

"I got extremely stressed in workplace and home. To speak I live in South East Asia, where work is long hours and pay is only enough to try to survive a month.

I have been managing my stress with family issues too so everything is a bit of a mishmash as I am angrily typing this down. And autism doesn't help with my stress management either.

I had been working in a shitty workplace. The pay ain't bad but to deal with my boss terrible management and temperament which makes his employee turnover rate is so high .People would stay around for a week up to 3-4 months, with the group chat kept having people leave and join. As of now there are around 15 people who have come and gone which I seen since the first day I joined and worked here up until now. I heard that this business has been running for 4-5 years now but from what I seen is almost like an enterprenuerial business with no idea and direction they wanted to do as they have tutoring, selling board games/blind boxes and even large figurine tradings, throwing menial tasks at every employee with focus on trying to get more employees to join. I worked around 11-12 hours on average so it makes me stressed at first.

Then a few days ago when I got home from work (around 11pm almost midnight) my dad called me in to have a talk with him, then he explains that he's worried about my health and my body health. At first I didn't think about it much. Me and my father didn't go well for a long time so I think of it more as of a warning, however it turned to make me angry and stressed as he simulate what will happen to me by imagining if I were turned into a disabled person and unable to move at all, with me still able to talk. I got so stressed and tired enough that I didn't get enough sleep after I finally got to excuse myself.

And comes up to today as I had enough with today as I tend after their store and I was a little loopy, I looked like I was sleeping when I'm actually trying to stay awake. The owner called me that he's been watching me sleeping for 15 minutes and he's going to cut my pay. Then he ordered me to go to wash my face. i did before coming back, so angry and annoyed that I slapped the store's security camera, HARD. Luckily it didn't break just the camera cable disconnected so it's an easy fix. So I just called the manager and told them that the camera accidentally fell to the ground and broke, saying that it worked fine after I reassembled it. I was a little panicked but a little less stressful from that.

Sorry it's more of a rant post, but I do need help managing my own stress and it just came up almost everyday. How do I do it? I felt like I could explode at any point right now.",Stress

"Lamictal and Memory Loss Hey everyone!  I'm 17 here, going on 18.  I first started taking lamictal in early 2016 to treat my depression, but only started taking it consistently a few months ago.  I used to just take whenever I'd wake up, which could range from anywhere from the early morning to late in the day, but the only noticeable effect that it produced was that if I missed a dose, my body would physically crave it.  

A few months ago, I began taking it at a regimented time everyday, as to give it the opportunity to properly regulate in my system.  About a month into doing that, I started to feel different.  I've always been one of the sharper kids, praised for my vocabulary and my writing ability (which may not come off in this post, but I'm really just looking for help here).  It's all that I really had to pride myself on at a young age and it carried over into just being a part of my identity; but over the past two months, I've just felt like I've been losing myself.  I struggle to keep up in conversation, my word find seems to come and go, and I just feel slow.   I know that I'm functioning at a technically normal level, but I feel like a piece of me is missing.  I've also been having terrible mood swings, going from happy, to sad, to complacent, to ragingly angry within about twenty minutes.  I know that I'm functioning at a technically normal level, but I feel like a piece of me is missing.

My biggest concern, though, is that I'm experiencing brain damage, as I've banged my head up a little bit.  This started getting really bad around the same time I started better regulating my dosage and I'm not discounting that as a possibility, making it hard for me to figure out if it's my medication or if I just destroyed myself for the rest of my life.  At the same daily dosage for nearly two years, I've never experienced anything like this, so my question would be this: Was my irregular dosing the reason that I wasn't experiencing these things earlier and will these effects go away after I wean myself off? 

EDIT: I've had a significantly worse sense of humor over the past month.  I know that this sort of thing is common, but can lamictal actually make you more serious? I can't seem to find anything on the subject.",Bipolar

&amp;#x200B;

So, i'm here because i can't honestly tell if the situation im in is entirely in my head. Short background, in august 2018 .i had some fatigue, joint pain, intestinal issues and i had missed my period 2 months straight so i went to the dr and after bloodwork they determined i had hyperthyroidism and a positive ANA. They also found my sed rate to be elevated slightly and my CRP was around 7. 5 months of doctors visits, a loose diagnosis of thyroiditis (after my levels went from hyper to hypo), and then normalized blood work (back in normal range for thyroid and ANA). I basically get a clean bill of health, all my bloodwork looks good. Except my symptoms worsened. My anxiety and depression also got worse which is why im wondering if im just manifesting symptoms because of my mental health

&amp;#x200B;

The symptoms i had that were strongly associated with thyroid have mostly gone away except for the fatigue, but now new stuff is popping up. For the past month i've been having period problems, abdominal pain and gastro problems. 

I had a normal period in the last week of december, but then 2 weeks later i had 6 days straight of weird heavy spotting. throughout this time (technically since august actually) i was having diarrhea every morning without fail, and intermittent constipation. it came with abdominal cramping and severe nausea that goes away after i use the bathroom. I also completely lost my appetite and was having really strong nausea almost daily. I had stretches of days where i just couldn't bring myself to eat despite being super hungry, it just made my stomach turn. Despite eating less than i usually do, /and/ the fact that i usually lose weight really fast when restricting calories, I've been gaining weight and my stomach has grown so big i can barely fit into my pants. Shortness of breath has become a weird problem too. idk if its related. ive always been bad at breathing but i get winded getting off the bed to use the bathroom. laying down on my back makes me feel like i cant breath too.

Yesterday i went to the ER because since about 1/12 i've been getting really intense sharp/twisting pain in my lower left and lower right abdomen as well as a general dull ache right above my groin. The stabbing comes and goes, sometimes there will be 1-2 min stretches where it is extremely painful/waves of stabbing pain but then i wont feel it for another few hours. I recently looked down and realized the left side of my stomach is bulging out a little farther than the right side. Its hard to tell, as i have a softer stomach anyway. I was supposed to get my period on 1/25 i believe, but instead i had spotting the whole week and then on 1/28 during one of my classes i got horrific lower back pain and strong cramps. I had severe nausea and the pain was so bad i nearly cried. And yet, still only occasional light spotting. This is highly unusual for me as i usually have very light and painless periods with only moderate cramping *exactly* when i start bleeding. I took tons of painkillers and fell asleep but woke up in just as much pain and still hadnt started bleeding. So i went to the ER the next morning

They did an internal ultrasound, bloodwork and a urine test. The blood and urine came back mostly fine. They confirmed that my thyroid levels were normal, and my liver and kidneys are in good order. Lymphocytes are a bit low, globulin a bit high, and in the urine test they picked up some protein and blood but they assumed that was from traces of the spotting i was experiencing. The ultrasound found that my ovaries and uterus look ""unremarkable"". There were ""small follicles"" present, as well as evidence that a cyst may have ruptured on the right ovary and there was a small amount of free floating fluid. Shortly before i left, i started bleeding normally as well. I was surprised honestly. Looking down and seeing how bloated i am and feeling the immense pain on my left all the time, i really expected them to find something. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still in immense pain and i'm confused. This all set off alarm bells in my head. i tried to brush it off for a long time but the pain just got worse and worse. I'm gonna obviously wait out my period and see if the pain persists after. I have a CT scan scheduled (ordered by the dr on my campus, i had gone to her about the pain a few weeks before the er thing happened) for feb 9th but it costs $3k for me.. I don't want to waste the money if i wont find anything. I can't keep wasting money on medical bills that aren't helping me

"Stress Headache? Hi 27M, 185lbs, 5'11 here.

No affirmations necessary, your brain will sort things through by itself.Coping strategies are basically everything that make you feel good immediately (your smartphone, food, drugs...).

What your mental illness will be in the end depends on the person, some might get ocd and do compulsive information seeking, some might become grandiose narcissists and completely ignore their problem and just make it their daily life to get affirmation from others on social media.that is the thing about self esteem: It does not need a reason.Narcissism always needs a reason, mostly multiple times a day a.

"Hands shaking - coordination awful - how to cope? Hi everyone, first post so I’m sorry if I’m doing this wrong. 

I’m teetering on the edge of a massive down at the moment while my pills even out (just upped dosage) and alongside the other crap I always get really bad problems with my hands and coordination. I feel like I can’t close my hands properly, as if all the heaviness goes into them, and when I try to concentrate on them they just go shaky. My shrink says it’s a normal symptom of depression (lack of coordination) which is fine; my problem is that I’m a piano teacher and every time this happens it makes it almost impossible to demonstrate exercises for my students, or convince them that good technique pays off. Not to mention I keep dropping/breaking things. 

Has anyone found a way to work around this? It doesn’t help me to have “proof” that I’m useless/bad at my job/clumsy when I’m in a down, and like I said I’m definitely heading there this weekend.

"Tendency to shutdown I'm sure I'm not the only one doing this but I find myself shutting down and withdrawing from people and situations to such an extent that I am unable to look them in the eye. It is triggered through different mechanisms but most often than not it is triggered by a situation in which I feel less worthy than what I already am.

I have low self esteem and an extremely negative view of myself. Notwithstanding my past having an influence on that view. 

Some situations may come across as innocent; suppose you were friends with someone. Not direct friends, a friend of your significant other or a friend of a friend. This friend takes interest in you only at times where they are in your company. Or having a mental meltdown in my case. They never text. Truth be told, they never even ask about you.

Another example, people ask you your opinion about something. You give it thinking it may be of use but then it turns out they didn't even bother listening. Or they brag to you about a choice they made when you suggested it in the first place. 

You feel like nobody sees you. Nobody respects you. Nobody listens to you.

I withdraw and I shut down. Although I can try and look past it, I can never truly get over it. It adds to my negative outlook on life and it breaks me down further. Soon there'll be nothing left to break.

"Medication adjustments, I'm frustrated . 22/F, Bipolar 2. I need a rant . I'm in college. I struggled with schooling my entire life, I guess for the simple fact that things don't hold my attention or interests for long. Pair that with depression and random hypomania, anxiety and well... nothing good. I dropped out of hignschool but got my vrade 12 and now I'm trying to better myself . While I'm doing better than before due to medication, it's still a struggle. 
Back in February  2017, I made the hard choice to see my doctor and have a referal put in to see a psychiatrist . Since I live in a shitty area, we have one fly in once every so often. So when I seen him, he put me on lamotragine and said that was the issue at hand to be dealt with first, then we would see what the next point of action would be (ADHD, depression, anxiety). Since I've been doing well with anxiety, he suspected ADHD would be next and seemed to think I would be able to notice after the dose was increased a few times. 
 Fast forward to today. I'm on 150mg of lamotragine, clonazepam as needed (when I get aggressive, panic attacks etc). I was leveled out for months at 125mgs, but had a checkup for refills back in October where my family doctor increased them because the psychiatrist wanted to see about getting me up to 300mgs. Since it was what the psychiatrist wanted, family doctor wanted to keep increasing to ""see what the differance is""... I was hesitant because I'm in school, I don't want to jeopardize anything, and this dosage I was on was tried and true as far as I was concerned. After telling him how I felt he said ""your feeling good now, maybe you could be feeling better"" so... benefit of the doubt, I did as I was told. 
Yesterday I had another appointment. I went in, figuring it was the usual routine. Told him I couldn't concentrate, I was feeling distracted often and easily, and my interests were shifting pretty often so I was concerned. I asked to see the psychiatrist again to talk about ADHD since that's what was suggested before, and seems to be what I'm dealing with. I was told WE DONT HAVE ONE RIGHT NOW.... BUT would very soon and I would have a referral put in  to see him/her for when we do and they visit. Awesome, right? 
So now he wants to lower my dosage back to 125mgs to ""see the difference"" which is the same shit I was told when he increased it to 150mgs. I don't want to do that. I'm uncomfortable, possibly distressed about the thought of it altogether since I'm so sensitive to these things. I can't afford a hypomanic/depressive spiral right now, not while I'm in school... so I'm thinking I'll just keep my dosage until I see another psychiatrist....  FML",Bipolar

Unfortunately, my excitement for giving this gift turned to anxiety as I became concerned about how such a (relatively) nice gift might be perceived being given to a friend of the opposite sex....

Recently I have become aware of just how deeply it affects my life on a day-to-day basis, and I guess I am struggling accepting that part of myself. It does not help that I have had this premonition (I get premonitions a lot, and I know how it sounds, but they are actually very spot on) of the year 23 since 2016. I always felt it as an end, an end to what I could see anyhow, so I was not sure what it really meant. I turned 23 in August last year and it is been a pretty tense year, I have been scared of big trucks (bc that is how I am going to go) but I knew I would /know/ when the time came... well... yesterday it did... a week from now, I just feel it. And all the things that have stopped me before when I have been suicidal are either solved or do not bother me anymore. So I am just trying to figure out what to do in the meantime? I have considered going to the ER and ask for help, but I do not know what to tell them.. that I know I am going to die in a week? it sounds stupid...But I really feel no need to live any longer, I am happy with the life I have lived, and I feel like it is just the end of the road for me.do not know if anyone here can relate at all, or have any advice, but I really just wanted to tell someone.

I spend weeks dwelling on how to begin a hobby before eventually losing interest on even starting ot convincing myself that I am not going to do good at it so why bother. Or, if I am lucky, I try it, and enjoy it (looking at you crochet) and then lose interest in two days. I want to learn Spanish and now would be the perfect time to learn it. Where I work we have a lot of Spanish speaking customers, and a lot of my coworkers speak Spanish. I could get a lot of practice, and there is no better time to learn it than now.

She awkwardly chucked and walked away. Instead of being proud of myself for going for a walk alone I spend that rest of the day feeling like a dumbass. I do not hate bees at all, bees are lovely little pollinaters who help the planet, but now this women on my neighborhood might see me again and think that I am the crazy chick who hates bees.I want to backpack Europe one day.

I have got a girlfriend recently its been like 5 months and we meet in person twice or thrice in a month, and I met her yesterday too, when I am with her I pretty much enjoy everything, the feeling of hugging her, kissing her, and just doing stupid things together, but as soon as I drop her home its like all the memories just fade away, right after I drop her home I forget the feeling of huggin her, kissing her. I usually took this for granted all the time but yesterday after dropping her at her home tears started coming out of my eyes because of how much I hated this. I actually don't have anyone to talk about this with neither can I go to a therapist or whatever, can anyone please please please help me a little bit. 
I will appreciate it a lot.

"The Root cause of my AVPD I have spent a lot of time thinking about how I ended up with this disorder. Constantly reviewing and analyzing my past memories, trying to find and pinpoint the exact event that caused me to be this way. I wasn't sure I had one, and I still think it may be multiple events in my life that led to the development of this disorder. But for me, I think the formation of my AVPD has always been interlinked with my sexuality. I am gay and Hispanic. Growing up in a Mexican household, parents are not accepting of that whatsoever. Anyways, I remember I still remember this time where I was looking up basically dick pics and I didn't delete the search history. I was 13 at the time and was barely discovering porn. My mom checked it before any of us got home and while she was at work later she called my dad and told him about what she found. My dad told me that she was crying because she couldn't accept that her son might be gay. I explained it away to my dad that I was just checking to see how I sized up to other boys my age. But I sorta knew what I was doing.  I guess that moment was pretty scary to me. Knowing not even my own parents would accept me. And so I hid myself, for a long time. Pretending to be straight year after year. It just got harder every year to put on the mask. And still now at the age of 24 I have never told anyone in my personal life that I'm gay. Not like they don't know it or highly suspect it, even though I present myself more masculine. I've never had a girlfriend so I think it's pretty obvious to everyone. But anyways I think it was very much so having to do with moments like I first mentioned. Where I was scared and felt completely alone. I guess it would have changed everything to have someone to tell me it's ok and that there's nothing wrong with me and that I'm loved just the same. But I didn't get that. I just learned from an early age that I was different and so I would be treated differently, unless I hid it.",Personality disorder

"Anyone ever done a liver cleanse? It honestly sounds like bullshit but I’ve hit a wall recently so I’m willing to expand my options a little. 

I was telling my pdoc about how I’m struggling recovering from the holidays. When I was out of town with my family for about a week, I had one beer the entire time. My four hour drive home ended up being six hours due to three separate accidents. It was taking me multiple days to recuperate, it felt like I had been on a drinking binge. When I told her all this, she said sometimes stress and changes in the environment can affect the way your liver functions just as much as it can affect your brain. The stress of family then being hit with an especially stressful trip from sea level to 7,000 ft could have really messed things up. 

So I’m giving this a try. She ordered some “liver sauce” for me. It’s this gnarly tasting oil I take as soon as I wake up then thirty mins later I have to take a charcoal binder. 

If it were some random person telling me to ditch my meds and do a liver cleanse instead, I’d tell them to fuck off.

"Severe Hypochondria after Being on Accutane Hey everyone. Most of my life I have never thought twice about a physical symptom and was confident in my health. However, that changed when I went on Accutane to help my cystic acne in August 2018. I started experiencing physical symptoms such as an increased resting heart rate all the time (around 100 or more bpm when it used to be around 75), stomach issues like indigestion and weird bubbling/gurgling coming up my throat and noises in my stomach when I sucked it in and out which I later researched and believe is succussion splash. I was feeling very anxious about how my body was feeling and felt like I was changing, like I wasn't the same person. I know Accutane is associated with horror stories so that just fueled my anxiety. I stopped the medicine at only 2.5 months instead of completing the full course which was supposed to be 6 months. I was so concerned about my symptoms that I went to three doctors, got an EKG, echocardiogram, different blood tests, and capsule endoscopy. Doctors said everything was normal. Cardiologist agrees that my pulse was a little higher than normal but still in the ""normal range"" and that it's nothing to be worried about (diagnosed it as ""inappropriate sinus tachycardia"") I haven't been able to do things normally since then. I have had better days where I forget my symptoms but it has been bad lately. I went on a trip recently with my mother and I was incredibly anxious the entire time because my symptoms were heightened. I never had trouble with trips so the fact that I am unable to handle things the way I used to is very concerning. I haven't been able to eat normally as I feel nauseous often and have lost weight without trying. I have also felt dizzy and numb? Half of me is saying there is something is terribly wrong with me and that I need to get more tests done and second and third opinions and the other half is saying that my anxiety is what is actually causing the symptoms. It's a vicious cycle. I never used to be this way. It started when I took that medication and my mind is telling me that I will never be the same because of 2.5 months on an acne drug. Meanwhile doctors told me that I am 100% healthy. Please give me advice on what I should do.",Anxiety

"Anxiety after the gym Ever since I started going to the gym , I have fallen in love with it. I look forward to it everyday as it completely distracts me from whatever it is I might be dealing with in my head. I usually go in the evening and up until then I'm fine. But I swear that drive back from the gym and when I'm sitting in my room all alone, can be extremely excruciating sometimes. The anxiety feels like a balloon going up and up into the sky, eventually it will pop and come back down. It's just an awful feeling, and I feel it almost every time now. I wonder if anyone else has felt it or knows what I'm talking about? It's such a terribly lonely feeling I get. I think what really bothers me more than anything in my life is this belief I have that I am not a good person. I mean it's not like I'm cussing people out or being a dick to anyone. It's more like I treat people like they don't matter or mean anything to me, it's an extremely shitty thing to do. Like I see a lot of the same people every day, and I think normally this would result in you forming a bond with them slowly at least. But it's not like that, everyone that's not in my immediate family just gets kept at arm's length.

"I’m worried I’m second choice I met a guy on a trip two years ago. He told mutual friends that he liked me, and he asked them not to tell me, but they did. When he found out that I knew, he cut off all contact with me. Two months later, he and his girlfriend broke up. I have to admit that before he was single, I'd look at his TikToks a lot. I never liked or commented on it; I'd just watch the videos.

A few days before he and his girlfriend broke up, I noticed that my TikToks would go up. I had 3 followers, but whenever I'd watch his videos, a few hours later, my TikTok views would rise. I even tried doing it on certain days; eg. I'd watch his videos one day, watch it two days later, then the day after, and each time I saw them, my views went up, and on the days that I didn't watch them, they stayed the same. This continued for the better part of a year. Last year, it was still frequent, but less so. Now, it's every two or three weeks that we do this. One time, he even posted a TikTok in English (English isn't his first language, and all of his previous videos were in his native language).

TikTok wasn't the only platform he was looking at me on. He would do it on Twitter too. One time, I retweeted a picture of a Star Wars character. Less than an hour later, he posted a meme of that same character. The meme was in English, and it's not that I want to say that the meme wasn't funny, but it was obvious that he posted it just to post it. There's been at least three other instances where he did something similar.

However, twice he did things that tickled me funny. About six months after they broke up, he started following her on TikTok, but unfollowed her within a few hours (probably because she didn’t follow him back). A month later, one of his ex's close friends posted a TikTok video with his ex in it. He started following this friend. Around eight months of this going on, he made his Instagram and TikTok private. I have no idea why. But I can tell he still looks at my TikTok, because TikTok tells who looks at your profile. I don’t post much, and he looks at it every two to three days.",Personality disorder

"Latuda Dose Increase?

my pdoc suggested i go from 20mg latuda to 40mg. i'm thinking about agreeing to it and increasing before i have an episode that forces me to switch up my meds.. i just have a few concerns about increasing...  

i haven't experienced any side effects from latuda. what are some of the things to be aware of that you guys have experienced when you started taking it or when you increased your dose? next, do i need to eat even more before i take it? that may be a dumb question but the nausea is excruciating when not eating enough even after 20mg. and last, did you guys like have any side effects after increasing? maybe being overtired or a major mood shift?

I don’t have much contact with her as she ran away for drugs when I was a kid, but have tried to be a part of her life now for a few years. She was in rehab and were now a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, but then she called me the other day very drunk and it hurt me so much and made me worried. I sent a message to my family member who has the most contact with her where I said she was drinking again, that I feel really sad and I don’t know what to do, feel helpless, etc. I also sent something similar to my grandpa, because he’s working with her (she lives in a psychiatric apt). Now it’s been days and I’ve gotten no response. I feel anxious and regret sending the messages, they probably think I was on drugs or crazy for sending desperate messages like that, and therefore not responding. I want to unsend the messages but I’m not sure if that would be acceptable to do, or look weirder if I do that. I’m considering texting my grandpa something else after unsending, but my other family member I don’t know that well and can’t really do that.

"It's easy to say that everyone has worth. If I say that I am a worthless subhuman, most people will react by saying something like everyone has intrinsic value, and that you don't need society or other people to validate your existence.

What is difficult is to *feel* that you actually have value, when such a big part of your life has passed without anyone seeing that value in you. I'm not a bad person, but frankly, I'm barely a person. I'm unable to do the majority of things most people do. I lack any semblance of personality.

"Hard lymph nodes on mastoid bone and back of neck. Hello Reddit.

Im a 28/male/6'7/200lbs.

For months now I've had two rock hard lymph nodes behind my ear on the mastoid bone. On top of that I've had one right next to my spine on the back of my neck, right around my hairline. I've been having some neck pain and headaches non stop for three months. I've also noticed I have some brownish skin spots in my hairline. I've also noticed if I dig my fingers down in my skin near the node in my neck, it feels like I can grab this round lump.

I've been to the doctors and they brushed it off. they assured me its not cancer,is or anything like that. They me on some antibiotics a few months ago and it did nothing. They're not red, or painful. They're hard and kind of fixed in place. They aren't growing either. They've been the same size the whole time.

"Worried about stomach cancer Hi! 19 F here. For the past 6 months I get very nauseous very easily, especially after eating or when stressed. Since around November, I’ve started puking regularly. I’ll puke once a day for maybe a week, then be fine for a week. During bad episodes I puke anywhere from 3-7 times a day. I’ve been gaining weight since this happened. Haven’t vomited any blood (red color is from foods I have eaten). Diarrhea usually precedes the vomiting, and has a certain smell (smell only occurs in diarrhea RIGHT before I puke). Immediately after puking the nausea goes away until the next episode. Symptoms worsen before exams, presentations, stressful events. Ulcer has been ruled out. My brain is going straight to the assumption I could have cancer and I am terrified :(",Anxiety
"I do not debate with myself anymore about the outward circumstances impacting me. It feels like I suffered deafness from sudden impact to my mind. I can still see, hear, feel what is going on around me but it is all muted. I have become so detached I am starting to not even ruminate on things anymore. There is just silence. A stillness inside. An acceptance. A knowing: this is what life is, this is what people are like, this is your life. Meaningless receptor of pain. A type of damage and grief that is so large it has become a void inside me without echo. I just exist in it. Laying staring in the distance. I stopped fighting. I lay dying figuratively now. Just darkness, the silence, the depth, the fright, the terror. I feel like an helpless animal that was being attacked so at first I fought frantically. Now I just lay no longer fighting back, not crying though the pain is present, being terrorized abused, destroyed. I am disassociating as I lay dying. My breaths are heavy like my mind. I do not care anymore. I am free falling in slow motion in the void. A ghost in a she will. Does anyone else feel this way? Did I explain myself well? When it all became silent",Suicidal

"how to gently ghost an avoidant without making feel them guilty? so, throwaway because i’m afraid she might be in this sub.
before asking the real question, long story short (tldr at the end):

so me (22m) and this girl (20f) matched on tinder a year ago, we want on a date and then she ghosted me the day after.
tried to talk to her one day after few months, got a single message reply and then she disappeared again.
at the end of last year i notice she was on hinge saying she broke up with her bf, so i started posting instagram stories that she might’ve been find interesting, and she started liking them, so after a while i reached out to her and wishing a happy new year. she seemed kinda interest, so we made plans for the following week.
she ghosted me again. i was disappointed.
after few days i noticed she had put me back in the close friends (she removed me from it after the first ghosting) so i thought “mh she might be to ashamed to write me back after all this time, i’ll reach out again” 
and since then we never stopped talking anymore, but here comes the problem.
we just talked for a couple months, i tried not to push anything to don’t let her make uncomfortable and run away again, but she basically is just venting on me, and now she started venting also about “male friends” on and on, so i got suspicious, and i was right, she’s back on hinge with a fresh new verified and recently active profile. 

now here comes the problem, and i don’t mean her being on hinge, at least not directly.
-she’s in therapy and on meds, i’m pretty sure her therapist wouldn’t suggest her to be on hinge (correct me if i’m wrong). 
-she said she couldn’t drink cause of meds and of med swings, but few days ago she started hanging out at night (she couldn’t do it before hanging out with me couple weeks ago) with “a male friend” and wanted to get drunk ( 🚩).
-she said she’s to anxious to hang out with people outta blue ( 🚩).
-we were talking about hanging out again, said she was super busy, got even more busy with college lessons, but she found the to hang out with somebody else, while i’m being her emotional support for the last 2-3 months 
-didn’t text me back for couple days after hanging out with that guy

so the real question is: how do i gently end up things with her? i don’t want to make feel her guilty, but i can’t keep stressing myself this much

i thought she’d made progress with her therapist, but apparently she isn’t doing much of what they says, so i think she might be helpless and toxic, and mostly we aren’t on the same page, i truly love her and i think she knows but she’s playing with me and using me just to vent and for not feeling completely lonely 

TLDR after being ghosted multiple times with a girl with avpd, adhd and probably bpd too (i’m referring what she said to me), we seemed to bond for once, but she might be a toxic person and i don’t think i don’t want keep pursuing this anymore , i’d like to slowly walk away without hurting both of us. 
she probably know i’m in love with her and she’s playing me. even if i’d come out and we’d make things work (quite impossible imho) i’m not sure she might be a good fit.

"Recently I have started this internship and moved to this really amazing city, an opportunity I have been waiting for one and a half year but unfortunately for me, I absolutely hate the work that I have to do. Ironically from a general point of view it is really not awful and while I am fully aware of it, it still everyday kills me a little more. However this internship was my way-out ticket from last year which was one of the worst years of my life. we have got sent home from uni, my 3rd and last study year became online and I do not think I have ever encountered so much loneliness, isolation and dullness like I did during the pandemic in my life. Besides work and work again though on my 2 days off I either read or stay in my hotel room. Have got absolutely no one to do anything with. Go out, hang-out, eat or explore the city and doing all these things by myself just makes me feel even more alone than I am so it seems like that is it. that is where my life stops. And I am stuck. Because even though I feel like I cannot stay here any much longer I know for sure I can not go back home. Because as little as I have here, I literally do not have anything back home. No friends, no group, no social life absolutely nothing. And that makes me feel like I am completely missing out on life, at 23 when I should be living my best years, gain all these experiences and feel young, I feel old and tired and absolutely broken inside. I just can not fathom why seemingly I can not have a more active life. what is painful is that I am someone to who being active and friendships count a lot and yet no matter what I try or where I end up, it is always the same pathetic record - me being so on my own and never having friends ever since I have graduated high-school. I honestly just do not know what to do anymore. Where to go or what to follow but this can not be it. it is exhausting feeling and living this way. Doing and having nothing and holding back crying almost every day. A huge part of why I am so unhappy that is probably even more excruciating is the fact that I am not able to do what I am really passionate about professionally. The school I ended up going to was a plan B. I have chosen it after already dropping out of another one and deep down even though I was hopeful I have knew I would probably end up here. that is the thing about plan B's is not it? I think that is exactly the reason why I am so lost and cannot seem to find my place in this world. I have tried so many different things and they all were such a clear reminder that I know I am on the wrong path and that my biggest issue starts from there. I have grown up with an immense love and fascination for film and I do not think there is anything that I would want to do more than film-making. Unfortunately in my home-country there is no school or even an industry for that and abroad I just simply can not afford to study. it is literally the only thing I know in my bones I would be good at. it is hard to explain but I just feel it. What I am having a hard time with is understanding why is that my so-called professional call if that is literally the only thing I would want to do, but cannot. It consumes me how much I would want to at least be able to try to do something about it but cannot. And accepting whatever's left instead just kills me and clearly even though I have tried and am still trying even these days is not a healthy option. Lastly I just want to quickly mention that for some reason even though I love reading, books make me feel even worse. I have been reading a lot of YA and they all depict a reality I would like to find myself in. All the laughs, all the friends, all the parties and crushes are exactly the elements I am missing and have always been missing from my life. And this is exactly why I feel like I do not belong. I feel things differently. Maybe I just feel more. People nowadays are so shallow and to me valuing things, being genuine and having genuine connections is still so important. I have got so much life in me and things I would want to do, places I would want to visit but here I am. Maybe I am just delusional, maybe I have high-functioning depression, I have been thinking about therapy a lot but I just know that it is not going to magically give me neither friends nor the career and life I would like to have. I just feel like I am not right for this world, I honestly do and even though I am not suicidal and I would never do anything to harm myself death seems like such an easy way out. As if tomorrow I would be told I have a terminal disease it would give me a twisted purpose because for the first time in my life I would know where everything is headed to. This one and a half year for some reason I can not begin to tell you how much I have thought of that. Anyhow, thank you a lot for taking time to read this if you got to this point any advice is much appreciated! I think I am never actually going to have a life or find my place in this world",Suicidal

"Any strange things you do when feeling anxious Started thinking about this today when out for a walk as I noticed myself constantly touching my bellybutton and stomach when I was starting to feel that tight, anxious feeling. I seem to do this without thinking and I am sure to people walking past, it looks a bit strange! I remember also in the past when I would get anxiety attacks or feelings of even slight panic, I would start touching my neck (maybe almost unconsciously due to my breathing). Not sure if it helps, but when I am not able to do it easily (say when driving or holding something) I feel a bit worse if that makes sense.

 These habits have developed very randomly for me over time and seem to come out as soon as I start having symptoms of anxiety and anxious thoughts.

"Hey here are some thoughts of mine I believe some or all of you could relate to for your next therapy visit.. AVPD In summary So I feel..

Sexually compulsive 

I feel energy drained.. stress accumulated leading to failure

Stress about just anything in general.. too much of it

Difficult to have own opinion, I doubt if I even agree on the way that I feel or think about a certain topic at times. I believe this stems from stress

Depressed.. sometimes I just feel like all the light and life has been sucked out of me at random times. Occurs usually when I’m around people, and gives me a feeling of desolation like I am emotionally alone in my own world

I want to finish this with a little bit of food for thought, of what I have come to a conclusion is what doubt has done in your life and mine

Guys think of any moment you’ve felt doubt.. remove moments of doubt which you can be sure of where the doubt came from like at school while taking a test. Now every other moment where the reason for the stress feels out there in the galaxy, that’s where I strongly feel stress inhibits us and we don’t even bat an eye and question it. But why question why you are stressed.. isn’t this just part of who I am? I should learn to live with it.. it’s so difficult to live this way, we are so intermingled with stress that it just becomes a part of us and sadly we stop seeing it this way for whatever reason we have, but doubt lives upstairs from us, casting a cloud over us every time it kicks and stomps over our thoughts and our ambitions into what feels like uncaring mundanity..",Personality disorder

"The Lithium struggle bus I have fluctu-weighted many times in my life, but I was by far the fattest towards the end of 2017. I've been steadily shedding pounds but a couple of weeks ago I started taking Lithium again. And while it's helped the mania, as of yesterday I've entered a new world of despair about my body:
So this past weekend I suddenly put on (at least) 10 pounds of water weight after binge eating socially and consuming hella sodium (I wish I could sue myself). I was also dehydrated because I'd been vomiting from the startup. My body quickly blew up like a balloon, my favorite sweatpants even became tight. I was uncomfortably bloated all over (I think the more fat you have, the more water you retain). Including my face-- which felt heavy &amp; the bags under my eyes were dark as hell.
So last night I drank a LOT of water, thinking that would fix it. But it only made everything worse. I peed ~10,000 times then went to bed. This morning I woke up and was pleasantly surprised with how tiny I looked. However, then I realized that my boobs looked different. They're still heavy, but squishier and hang a little lower. And my stomach is squishier. I can barely feel fingers against my skin now. My face has more wrinkles, my neck/chin curve feels loose. I feel like I've aged years overnight.
I fluctuated a net amount of at least 20 pounds in 2 short days, quickly up then back down. And now my skin is stretched too big for my body!?? If it is this loose already, I'm terrified to keep losing weight. I know it happened so fast. Freshman + sophomore year I was so thin and beautiful and taut. :( Im a senior now, so I was already feeling shitty before this happened. Feels like I've lost myself. Who is this bitch in the mirror with the body of a postpartum mother of quintuplets....???? I've never come close to having a kid, let alone 5. Yet here I am. And I don't know if I should try to fill back out a lil or what?

"I hate this stupid disease. My HA first manifested itself when I was a freshman in college. I felt a coldness in my chest  on the way home for a weekend (probably a flare up of the anxiety I didn’t know I had,  triggered after moving away from home for the first time, dealing with college life and new workload, homesickness, my parents moved from my respective childhood homes, first childhood pet died, etc). 

I googled my symptoms and that’s where it all went downhill. Heart attack. All of the sudden I was sweating, shaking, chills, feeling of doom, lightheaded, I truly felt I was going to die. To the point I told my mom not to be sad when I inevitably died.


Later that night I had a two hour long panic attack. I begged my boyfriend to drive an hour to where I was to take me to the hospital to which he obliged. I missed my sister’s college graduation party sitting in the hospital getting laughed at and joked on by the doctors and nursing staff. “Did your boyfriend break up with you recently?”, “Are you on your period honey?”.

Subsequently that semester I went to the emergency room two other times. One doctor gave me an emergency script for Paxil. Never filled it. Never wanted to. 

Went to a cardiologist, my pediatrician, gastroenterologist, got an endoscopy, etc. I even slept at the foot of my dad’s bed for a week because I thought He could save me if I died. turns out I’m a perfectly healthy 21 year old, which is great until I started searching “healthy 21 year old surprise heart attack” and other similar things. 

The anxiety subsided after about 8 months. A few months later it resurfaced when I convinced myself I had bed bugs in my apartment. Called the bug people 5 times, hired private bug people (instead of my apartment ones), stayed with my mom for a few weeks, begged my best friend to move. No bed bugs. 

Eventually I healed from that two and recently (random itching and a few colds) has convinced me I had lymphoma. A headache recently convinced me I had brain cancer or MS. A bruise on the back of my leg has convinced me I have a deep vein thrombosis for the last three weeks. 


My anxiety has caused me to have a slew of unimaginable PHYSICAL symptoms:
Arm and leg pain
Itchy skin
Chest pain
Tingling 
Numbness 
Panic
Sweating
Shivering
Rashes
Stomach pain 
Twitching muscles
Headaches
Heavy head
Pins and needles
Back pain
Joint pain
Susceptibility to more colds and flus
Mood swings
fatigue 
Lack of appetite
Increased appetite
Missed periods

I hate this terribly debilitating disease. A disease most people will never understand. Convinced my family and friends don’t believe me and don’t trust me and don’t take me seriously, convinced the doctors must be missing something, convinced I’ll be that rare case that dies at 21 from a heart attack. 

The worst part? I’ve been doing well, healing. Taking care of myself. It always comes out of no where. Three months of stress, no symptoms. A month later it all catches up to me.

When will I stop being a slave to health anxiety? Checking, poking, prodding, literally self inflicting bruises all over me from constantly pressing on my body parts to check them for changes, pain, sensations.

Please give me your success stories and small  victories😭

38 was over a decade ago, and since I had kids and a healthy body I allowed the year to pass.

Now I've been caring for my father for the past four months. He is frail, has a hard time walking, has multiple health issues, and is in constant pain. I look at him and think that's not an existence I want- I've led a rich and exciting life. He's less than 20 years older than me, so in him I see my near future...

I had ideation for a six month period years ago, but other than that I don't think about suicide. I'm not looking to end it all now, but this has been my plan for 35+ years. I now learn that bipolar people have 20x suicide rate vs the general population. 

When the time comes and my health &amp; quality of life start to tank, I'd like to go under my own terms.

Outside of crisis situations, do any/many of you have similar thoughts of a long-term planned end-of-life?

"needing validation ive never posted on this subreddit before because i am not officially diagnosed bipolar, but i went from MDD to an unspecified mood disorder in less than a year. some bg: im a college sophomore. the first time i ever went to therapy was march of last year. i started lamictal in december. growing up mental illness was just not a thing to my parents, so i never saw any doctor or pdoc.

basically, ive had to do and learn everything myself regarding mental illness and treatment. but i think im reaching a burnout. the lamictal is great, however my focus issues, which ill just address as ADHD (i have vivid memories of almost never sleeping during pre-school nap time and instead lifting up our bed mats with my legs, and ive heard my mom say she has it) are still something i don't have treatment for.


not being diagnosed with anything as a kid has made this journey incredibly difficult, especially concering ADHD. while ive improved drastically since freshman year (i had a debilitating depressive episode where i ended up with a 0.8 GPA), i haven't made progress with the ADHD. last friday i went to an ADHD screening for testing at my school's psych services office as im required to have the school's insurance anyways. it was the most discouraging experience.

i told the woman that ive had focus issues and homework issues for as long as i can remember.  i told her exactly what my thoughts would be like in a class, my horrible sleep quality, my difficulties around getting my work done, etc. i talked to her about the very recent development regarding my mood disorder.

she told me that she thinks what i was describing is related to other issues, which were ""out of their scope"" and recommended me to a doctor who has a semester long waitlist for full psychological testing. which would be at least $400, $4,000 if i didnt have insurance. 

last semester i dealt with ADHD by meeting with a professor every week to go over assignments. i got accommodations from a few classes even without being registered with disability services. however, that's not 100% the case with all my classes this semester. i was struggling before that screening but now im struggling even more. i have a test tomorrow morning i have not studied for, not to mention i did not do at all an essay assignment, and i havent done the workbook pages due by the test. i had to ask for an extension for a paper in another class the night before because i hadn't even written it. ive missed meetings and work.

that friday night i tried to find coke. sunday night i took 5 shots at 1am. monday i bought adderall and took 3/4 of it, and ive never taken adderall before. i have not done anything but stay in bed because the thought of even trying to tackle my immense amount of work is so overwhelming. 

i know it takes a while to get a diagnosis but like i said, i am feeling so burnt out. how many more doctors do i have to see? how many more episodes do i have to go through and other self-destructive behaviour? my family is no help either, my father threatened to not pay my tuition when he found out i was taking meds and refused to tell him. the rest are just invalidating. 

i don't know what to do or figure out what i need to find out. i am so tired of not having anything. my chest literally hurts and im curled up in bed in the dark crying. im sorry this is so long but ive never had the chance or resource to really talk about this stuff honestly that im just letting it all out now. im just desperate for some reassurance and validation at the very least.",Bipolar
"Struggling to discern between anxiety and ""real"" symptoms How does anyone manage to deal with health anxiety, when you clearly have symptoms of something and it isn't just a general worry about dropping dead from cancer or a stroke? 

A couple of weeks ago I noticed I had ""air hunger"", that sensation that you aren't getting enough oxygen and I have begun to get vertigo / dizzy or lightheadedness quite frequently. Here in the UK it is quite hard to get a Dr's appointment that isn't an emergency one and I have got one booked in for close to the end of the month. The last week has been horrible for me, because while realistically as a 29 year old I am not at a huge risk of lung cancer or heart failure and I cannot stop obsessing about how serious this illness could potentially be. Especially because it is clearly not a common cold, but if it is real maybe a viral infection like labyrinthitis. The problem is that the more I worry, the more things happen like palpitations, stomach ache and such like. All classic anxiety symptoms that I am sure are due to my HA, but my mind just cannot reconcile that the simplest explanation must be true. Its the opposite of how i operate as I am a scientist and normally think very logically. 

In the past I have spoken to the GP about my HA, but they don't really seem to do much about it. I asked if I could be refereed to someone, but instead was told to look up self-help related stuff online. Weirdly, I worry that being labelled as a hypochondriac on my medical records will bias a doctor towards me if I am require treatment. 

Just have no idea how I am going to get through the next few weeks until I can see a GP for a 10 minute ""lets do nothing and see what happens"" waste of time. ",Anxiety

"Can you relate to this type of psychosis/paranoia? 
I have BPD (borderline) and OCD. I also think I have some bipolar symptoms although I'm not attempting a self diagnosis or asking for one, I'm just curious if people here can relate to these experiences.
I'm 21 now, and when I was 14 while being hospitalized I went through a time for months - years where I was convinced I would be some sort of Steve Jobs/Elon Musk type figure. I'm pretty sure I was manic/experienced grandiose delusions. I can see this now, but sometimes still have these kind of experiences, it's like I'm looking for the ""ultimate purpose"", or ""meaning to my existence"" and it feels pretty great when I feel like I've found it for a bit but it doesn't stay that way consistently. Idk how to describe it exactly but kind of like there's a missing puzzle piece, sometimes I think I've found it and feel very driven, other times it feels like the puzzle is in disarray. Also I'm curious to hear from anyone who knows what it's like to dissociate, sometimes when I dissociate I'm just completely numb, but other times I think there's hints of mania... where I'm stuck in my head/dissociated but planning and ruminating frantically at the same time.
Also things like lack of sleep/drugs/stress often give me extreme paranoia, normally not lasting long (but sometimes months). I was concerned at one point that I might have been part of a government mind control/illuminati thing(and I'm still not completely sure I'm not). I've only once had an experience that I guess is a more obvious break from reality, where I heard voices mocking me..

"Wondering If I’m Bipolar... So, for as long as I can remember, I’ve had issues with mental health. It didn’t get bad until around 12, when I started self-harming, and eventually I was hospitalized at 14 after a suicide attempt. There, I was put on Zoloft for depression and also diagnosed with anxiety. For a few months, I felt happy so I figured it was working. I stopped cutting, I felt good. Eventually, I just stopped taking it without a doctor’s consent, but I took myself off of it slowly. I started cutting again after that. 

That’s my only experience with doctors/psychologists since and I’m 19, turning 20 in 5 months. 

I had my first hallucination when I was 16, but the timeline is so bad and foggy because my brain literally can’t remember anything besides the event itself - I was in the shower and just like flicking a switch, I thought somebody was in the bathroom with me, trying to “get” me. Immediately, I opened the curtains to find nothing but still wasn’t convinced. I went to my room, thinking something was following me from behind the entire time and closed my door, psychotically looking around for whatever was there trying to get me. For about 3 hours, I sat in the corner of my room, looking back and forth between things that would just escape my direct line of sight - it was like I could only see the “things” trying to get me in the corner of my eye. I wouldn’t move off my bed in fear that it was under my bed, and would snatch me that way. It felt so real at the time. I forgot it even happened the next day and didn’t remember it until months later, when it randomly popped into my mind, but I couldn’t place it along a coherent timeline - only that it had happened sometime that same year. 

A few months after I remembered the event, I was in class and out of nowhere (just like last time) I thought somebody (who, in my head, looked similar to the girl from the ring/exorcist) was inside the room with me. I started darting my eyes everywhere making sure that she wasn’t - it felt real but apart of me knew it wasn’t but that didn’t help it go away. All throughout the day I continued feeling like she was right behind a closed door, or peaking out at me from somewhere. On the bus ride home, I was convinced she was somehow following me, in vans, in cars, buildings - this thing that was following me didn’t adhere to the normal rules of transportation, she could transport between buildings just to keep an eye on me. It happened about three or four times, varying on levels of intensity for about two weeks and that was the last time I’ve had delusions or hallucinations (if that’s even what they are). 

Now fast forward to 2017, where after smoking weed one night I get put into this semi-catatonic state where I felt unreal, like a joke and like where I lived and the people around me were fake too. All kinds of memories of my childhood were playing on fast-forward on my head, except I was outside looking at my younger self and it was terrifying, I was convinced that I was actually going to die. Now, this experience is drug-induced but after this first time, I began having experiences like this without being high and the thoughts couldn’t leave my mind - I felt unreal, fake all the time, and occasionally I wouldn’t be able to view the world around me as real, or the people. This happened between July 2017 - December 2017, and it’s just starting to subside after I quit weed a few days ago. But, while it was happening, it left me in a severe depression. 

Now, since the new year, I have been energetic and positive - I feel better about my body (which, all throughout my life I have struggled with) and have positive thoughts about it. And not just “I love my body!” its more like “I can 100% fix my body and make it how I want it!” I didn’t sleep for 40 hours straight albeit a 2.5 hour nap before my shift. During work, I was talkative (which I NEVER am) and had something to say to about 99% of the customers. It was almost as if when the thought popped in my head, no matter what it was, I had to say it. Nothing inappropriate, mostly just about the products or casual talk or responses but it was so natural. My answers are NEVER natural because I have social anxiety - I’m always rethinking it before I say it. But not this time. I bagged their groceries so fast, I couldn’t stop singing songs in my head, occasionally singing them out-loud in front of customers and not feeling embarrassed (like casual singing when you have a song stuck in your head, except it was a few different songs) When I wasn’t with a customer, I couldn’t not be moving, my hands, my legs etc.

Once I got home, I became obsessed with watching and rewatching and tweeting about my favorite show. I had so many thoughts about the show and my favorite characters that I just had to put them out there. I think I tweeted about 500-600 times within 6 hours. On top of that, I was also writing some characters for a TV show I’m writing and usually I’m a little stunted w/ writing because I’m usually depressed but it was like I could write for ages. I wrote like 10 characters within an hour. 

This has been going on since the New Year, and I’ve gotten a total of... less than 20 hours of sleep within 5 days. And now I just got the idea that I want to finally get my license so I can get a car and runaway. I know, logically, the plan seems bad but it’s like I have no intention of doing anything else? Like all of my effort is going into that plan. 

And lastly, on top of all this, I haven’t eaten one meal since the new year and I don’t feel hungry at all. No desire to eat really, albeit a few snacks here and there. 

I’ve had past experiences with being energetic, so I always speculated whether I was bipolar but never like this. 90% of the time, I have been depressed

I now realise that it's too late. I grew in such an abusive family that I never learned how to love and relate. And then I fell ill. Since then I became disabled. 

Sometimes my arms hurt so bad, that I can't type. I've been trying to survive a gruesome situation for months now. I can only communicate in short bursts. All the rest that I need is gone. 

And I put myself out there. Ashamed and small. Guess what? No one cares. I'm at fault too. But it's not only me. I hope it will be over soon. But I rather struggle alone. I hope that I can get some of my hobbies back, take up space. 

I can't chat anymore, it makes me want to barf. I can't really go outside and to be honest, I am scared. I found out how easy it is to abuse me. It's not like I can run, just hide. 

There's nothing much to say. I truly am alone. I am different, but I just want to be in peace with myself, with the chronic pain, with the fact that people and I don't work together. I'm not charming or young. I'm just venting into the nothingness. 

I isolated more and more when I got negative feedback. It's too late now. Everybody struggles, I don't understand basic things. I just want the current crisis to be over. Don't want to improve myself. Or to function.

"Emerging for a nervous break down. There is hope. The last two years have been incredibly stressful for me. I’m a frontline healthcare worker who was dealing with the horrors of the pandemic on a daily basis. I took it all in stride and never saw what was coming my way. 

Around mid Jan (about 10 weeks ago) I started getting waves of exhaustion at work out of no where. I’m talking the type of exhaustion where I was basically paralyzed and had to lay down. One time I laid down on the floor at work because I had no other choice. 

The next week, I started having random chest pains on top of the exhaustion. At one point I thought I was having a heart attack and almost when to the hospital. I went to the doctors thinking I was having cardiac issues but everything checked out. I felt better…for a day or two…

Week 3 is when the real nightmare started. I started having intense anxiety (on top of the exhaustion). Multiple panic attacks a week. I couldn’t do anything without getting short of breath and my heart beating out of my chest. I was a complete mess at work and felt like I was going to collapse and die at any moment. Sometimes I was so physically stressed out I would go to the bathroom and lay on the bathroom floor. It was nuts. 

I called my doctor back and told him what was going on. I was reluctant to start meds but he talked me in to it. Said it doesn’t need to be forever and I can’t go on suffering like this. So I started a low dose SSRI. 

I also started therapy, took a week off from work and am doing much more self care. Like eating healthy and journaling. 

After about 6 weeks of hell, I’m feeling much better. I still have some anxiety here and there but for the most part, have returned to my baseline. I was convinced I’d never be the same again no matter what and I feel like it’s a miracle that I’m even functional now. 

Therapy has also been a huge help even though I was skeptical. It helped me understand that even though I felt blindsided by all of this, it really was building under the surface for a long time. 

Just wanted to say there is hope and don’t give up. I never thought that would happen to me and when it did, it was shocking. But things can get better!",Stress

"Going to Battle HA? Hi All,

First time posting here. So grateful to have found this community. I have struggled with HA for the last 10 years, with each year worse than the one before. 

For the last 6 months, my HA has been with leukemia. Usually my anxiety with any illness is from a few days to a few weeks, but never on the order of months. Enough is enough! I no longer want to live in fear of any random bruise (I am thin and bruise like a peach), or to have my husband constantly reassure me that I don’t have cancer and engage in my safety behaviors. 

A relative of mine is actually a clinical psychologist who deals with anxiety disorders. She referred me to a well-respected clinic that is able to work with my insurance and they want to schedule me for the intake. 

The problem? I’m scared to actually take the next step and start therapy. I’ve avoided dealing with my triggers and upbringing that promoted me becoming this way. The clinic specializes in exposure therapy for anxiety disorders and I am so scared thinking about putting myself in even controlled situations that will manufacture my anxiety.

I am about to turn 30 in a few weeks and although I have been fortunate enough to have had many women interested in me throughout the years, I just cannot seem to hold a stable relationship for longer than a few months. When I was younger it was not a huge deal, but now that I am getting older I am beginning to feel I may never be able to develop a long-lasting meaningful romantic connection with anyone and it makes me feel so deeply alone.The thing is, I am able to clearly see how it is me pushing my partners away. Once the initial excitement wears off, I go back to being aloof, insecure and self-centered and I can sense my masculine essence eroding. I can see how my partners go from being attracted to me to feeling sorry and completely turned off. I do not blame them. I do not want them to carry any of my burdens. I want to own up to them and keep fighting to get better. But with each passing relationship, I just become more afraid of opening up about my mental struggles and having them realize that the confident, fun version of me is kind of a part-time deal.On top of it all, I seem to be developing some kind of body dysmorphia.

I am rapidly losing my hair, about a third of my beard and body hair is already gray, I have bad eye bags and dark circles and, although I have tried, I just do not look good completely bald and I have been told as much by friends. I legitimately hate looking in the mirror most days. I even started dating older women in hopes that it would even things out, but the same thing happened.My last partner recently left me after I became insecure and started acting weird and it really hurt me because I actually did care about her. But somehow, just a week later, the universe has already put two new women in my life who are showing interest. The thing is, I am seriously afraid of trying this again and screwing it up once more. I do not think my heart can take much more disappointment and I am tired of superficial connections.I know I need to develop self-love and find something to get excited about every time I wake up before I try to find someone again, but the thing is I am also very lost and lack direction in life. The only thing I am truly passionate about is music, and that is just not going to pay the bills or provide me with the financial stability that a relationship requires. Besides that, I am working on finishing a degree in biochemistry (two semesters left), but I have no desire to go to grad school or Med school, and the job prospects with a B.S. in that field look bleak.Are there any guys out there who have managed to be in successful or satisfying relationships in spite of all your struggles? If so, how did you manage? I do not think my depression will ever go away at this point, and I do not want to end up alone or hurting myself and others even further. Thank you for reading.

"Found out I can press criminal charges against my childhood abuser: my mentally ill brother who attempted a school shooting I have a violet schizophrenic/autistic brother who SA me and almost killed me multiple times during rage or psychotic episodes. 

During these episodes, he would get violet in public. In middle school he had attacked the school cop, grabbed his gun, and tried to shoot at students leaving a school assembly. Lucky, the cop arrested him. After that, rumors started about me. I had left school for a year to deal with a serve kidney issue. Rumors came that I was in a mental hospital and no one would speak to me. 

Here is the thing: Both my parents are accomplished attorneys. They were able to have the charges dropped and he was home a year later. He would still hit me, strangle me, stab me. I had to sleep with a knife under my pillow because he would break in and watch me sleep while he spoke to voices in his head. 

A few years later he almost murderes my mom. He hit my mom with an iron bar over her head, one more hit and she would have been dead. Again, they played their cards and he was home within a year. I would state to my parents about the abuse, how I was scared for my life. 

They said I was overacting. Nothing was done to help me. I became so stressed and scared my awful father tried to put me in a group home because I said I didn't want to live there. Yet, the person who caused my distressed and harm was living at home and not in the mental institution.

I spoke to my therapist about this. She said since I'm only in my early 20s I can still press criminal charges against him. I am broken. I want to press charges but my parents will shun me. My parents help me financial since I am unable to work because of my kidney and seizure disorder. I know they would leave me homeless or try to get back at me and charge me with a stupid crime. My father was able to lie to the police operator about my mom to have her arrested and institutionalized. 

I am terrified of my father, and my mom cares more about my brother than I. She knows he raped me and hurt me, but still demands I come to his birthday or she won't pay my rent. Also, he SA my mom multiple times while I was a teen. Yet, my mom says she stays with him for his money. She would tell me thus as a teen, which is so sick to involve a child when you are staying with him.

I want to charge him so badly. My parents lied to me when I was a teenager when I wanted to go to the police. They said that the police won't help me. Finding our that my family lied to me, knew about the abuse, and now several years later learning he could have been charged is destroying me. 

I want to press charges. I have no money for an attorney.

I'd lose everything, become homeless, my mom who is the only person I care about would never speak to me again. I am having horrible flashbacks. My therapist also stated that I should be ""proud"" that I havnt killed myself, since most others would have with what Ive been through. This is after she knew I had slit my throat at 18.

"Do you think he might be abusive? As someone with AVPD, I don't date much, and I just want someone who will be loyal to me. It's very clear that he's attracted to me. I'm attracted to him too, but everyone says that I'm way too pretty for him. About two weeks into us knowing each other, he shared a really intimate story of a traumatic experience that happened to him. He’s a empathetic person that cares for other people, but he gets angry over minor things. I'm 95% sure he's gone to therapy, because even though he will explode at the most random times, there'll be other times when he's really good at conflict resolution.

Before we dated, I invited him to my birthday party. Supposedly, a few weeks before, he was flirting with me, but I didn’t pick up on it. So when I invited him, it confused him. He thought I was giving him mixed signals. On his Twitter (that I don’t follow), he was saying stuff like “playing with people’s feelings is bad” and “disloyal people annoy me”. The next several weeks, he gave me the cold shoulder and really did not want to talk to me.

He’ll also roll his eyes or grunt over relatively things that really aren’t a big deal. Sometimes I wonder if the thing that I did even warranted a sigh or eye roll. I’m just wondering, if I got into a relationship with him, would it get worse?

"Delusion or just incredibly elevated anxiety? Hi everybody. Last year I was diagnosed as type 2 because I haven’t experienced what I considered to be full blown mania—only hypo, and I’m extremely prone to severe depressed “lows.” 

However, I’ve been wondering a lot lately whether or not I’m just experiencing an intense level of anxiety/insecurity or if this crosses into the area of what would be considered a delusion. I haven’t had any of the more obvious signs of delusions that I’ve read about on here (i.e. thinking I’m God or somebody else or an informant, etc.), but I most definitely feel all the time like I can tell 95-100% exactly what people are thinking about me to the point that it hinders me from functioning in many instances. For example, I will literally coup myself up in my room for days/weeks because I feel like I absolutely know exactly what my roommates or friends/family/professors are thinking of me in these high and low emotional states and I don’t want to even confront them for this reason. I’ve even accused my mom of basically “thinking her thoughts” too loud at me or even lashing out when I think she’s judging me or thinking something extremely negative. She’ll obviously say things like I’m assuming way too much and I have no clue what I’m talking about and I still don’t believe her. 
 
I know logically when I think about this that it’s ridiculous but part of me also lets it affect me to the point that I will hide myself or freak out about it. The fact that I’m partially able to understand that this obviously isn’t the true case is what dissuades me from calling it a delusion, but it’s also so strong of a fear and “observation” that it makes me wonder. What do you think? Has anybody else experienced anything this? ",Bipolar
"Does anyone else have a Non Epileptic Attack Disorder (NEAD) ? it is quite rare but this is a large community of possible contenders for it. Basically it is a dissociation tactic the brain sometimes employs, causing fainting and even what may appear to be a seizure. In my case, I faint and go so rigid I shake and jerk from the tension. While my eyes flicker as I try and work back through the fog, to my body and who ever is shaking and making far way sounds at me. If roused by rigorous tapping and shaking it can last 2 minutes if left alone it can go on for up to 10 and then I truly pass out into a near coma like sleep for hours. Including face down in a puddle in the smoking yard at work! Luckily only a touch of hypothermia was the result. The other danger is since you make no attempt to break your fall when you pass out hitting your head can be a problem. Fortunately I have only had bruises and cuts without any major concussion or injuries.It is not however caused by abnormal electrical activity in the brain like real epilepsy so it is not respondent too medication. It is essentially a psychosomatic problem that requires CBT in order to retrain the brain to stop pulling the collapsing stunt everytime you feel like you need to dissociate. It took 14 weeks of intensive cbt therapy at the only hospital in the UK to have a unit for such conditions. The historic Bethlem Royal Hospital (once the infamous Bedlam) I was able to bring the seizures down from 5 or 6 a week to 1 or 2, and the recovery time form 8 hours to 1. Which is a big improvement but it still makes getting back into work difficult. I had to stop working before when the seizures were regularly, meaning I was forced to miss and cut short work shifts. Now that is it is less frequent, I still fear I go back into work the same thing will happen and I will let everyone down again, forcing them to scramble to cover me. Also I do not know hot to tell a employer 'yeah sometimes I might just collapse and have to go home.' I had depression before this but the absolute hold its put on my life is really piling on the depression.

"I'm BURNED OUT... What should I do? So, let me start by saying I'm 28 M, and I've been burned out for the last few years and just ""managing to get by."" I work a full-time 9-5 position (got promoted end of last year), I'm studying part-time in college (straight As till this recent semester, 3 courses every semester), I'ma caretaker and I take care of storeruns/bills/necessities for my home, and I have a significant other that I'm going steady with.

So, my job has gotten to become majorly overwhelming, but the salary's great for someone with no degree, and I'm very used to working with this employer and the work that we do—however between an occasionally toxic environment and daily demands that I'm struggling to focus on (due to my burnout), I fear for my job safety and am becoming miserable. This semester, I find myself having no energy to take on my schoolwork after the workday. I had no option for in-person classes, and all of them are reading and/or writing intensive, none of which makes it any better. As a result of these two alone, I've found myself too tired and stressed to desire nutritious foods, and have adopted poor eating habits... Finally, I'm proud to take care of business for my home, and to have a loving and supportive partner... however, I'm really beginning to tire of the workload, and the result it's taking on my mental health. I do not want to fail, nor be fired, nor disappoint my loves ones...

I know ""I'm worth it,"" and must take time for myself, but how? What does that truly mean? My breaks lately are watching a show while eating for a bit, or going to the market to shop for groceries... I haven't truly had a day off, and it's difficult to be ahead when you're working overtime at your 9-5 to catch-up to the constant demands.

Feared missing out important content until i remembered i can watch the recording later but didn’t really get rid of that unpleasant rushed feeling and anxiousness that i need to get this login resolved. Only until i got connected with the school IT helpdesk that i felt completely fine again

I seldom get nervous in job interviews but what is this??? Not sure why my body reacting like this if it’s just fear of falling behind/missing out

Pretty sure there’s a correlation between 2 &amp; 3

"Toenail Melanoma? This sounds so stupid, but I’m worried about toenail melanoma.  I recently removed my nail polish and noticed that on one of my toenails, a little less than half of it is a light brown color. The pigment starts from the edge of the nail so it’s not a sole brown line.  It just looks like half of my nail lengthwise is a darker shade. For reference I am under 30 and darker-skinned, and I’m fairly sure I’ve had this pigmentation for awhile and it’s been noticed by my derm, but since I’ve had my nails painted I’m worried that somehow it changed or it looks different than I remember. 

I know it’s more common on the thumbs, index fingers, big toes - and it’s not on either of those. My two pinky toenails also currently have some brown pigmentation basically covering the whole nail. In all three toenails have some funky darker pigmentation going on right now.  Admittedly this has been the first time I’ve cut my toenails in a little over a month so they were long. I also tend to wear heels frequently so I’m not sure if this pigmentation is more trauma based?

I’ve been to the derm a few times in the past year for cancer/mole related concerns so I’d hate to keep going back. Any thoughts?",Anxiety

"What was your tipping point in going to the doctor? Hello everyone, new person here. As the title states, what was the last straw that drove you to go to the doctor with concerns? 

Throughout my lifetime I have exhibited symptoms of bipolar disorder, or at least how google defines it anyway. My actions have certainly caused much trouble in my life at school when I was younger, in my marriage, and in my career. Whenever I try to explain myself to my wife I am always at a loss for words about why I do or say the things that I do. My actions are my own and not the result of something else, though.  

I honestly have no idea what to call it, or what to do about it. It would just be nice to talk to someone who understands what I am trying to say. Thank you.",Bipolar
"nsfw trigger warning:my whole life i have fantasized about the idea of dying. i met death once, it was a dark and quiet place, and i experienced what it truly was to be alone. expect this alone did not hurt, in fact it was relieving. so relieving that when i when i opened my eyes again i cursed every nurse and doctor who thought it necessary to save me. i, at the age of 11, decided that i no longer needed saving from the mess that i called life, i wanted to return to that darkness. i truly wanted to die. and with every year that i grew older, i fell more in love with closing my eyes for the final time. 11 years later i sit at the door of another birthday, another reminder that i am alive. a burden. a curse. what could i do the expire naturally? nothing, no disease i have or could possibly have would kill me any time soon. it is a matter i now have to deal with personally. suicide. suicide is such a scary word to utter. but not just because i am afraid of dying. i am. i am terrified. almost as terrifying as choosing the wrong number in an almost winning lotto ticket. if i go, would i possibly be missing a reason to live? but everyday the possibility of that seems unlikely, almost silly. suicide. i attend to commit suicide. i attend to revisit that quiet darkness and make it my home, a place where i can finally belong. to close my eyes and know that i can finally breath and be relieved of trying. today, maybe tomorrow, or maybe i can hold out a little longer, but eventually my only plan is to rely on suicide and finish what was started 11 years ago. today i made a decision",Suicidal

"I hate myself so much  I met this guy on vacation, and we hung out for two days at the pool. I'm a very socially anxious person, but with him, I felt like I'd known him for years. One night, he told other teenagers that he liked me. They told me, and they were hyping me up saying stuff like ""oh look your boyfriend's here"". I was so excited. I never had a guy like me before. I was bullied at school for being the quiet kid in class, and I would run to my parents, hoping they'd comfort me. But they'd get mad at me for being so quiet and they'd blame me too. I used to go up to my room at night and sing myself to sleep ""someday, my prince will come"". Now he was finally here. So I went up to him and asked him if he liked me. He told me he had a girlfriend, and got mad at our friends for telling me.

He cut off contact with with me. I was so sad that the one person who saw me for the good I have to offer, still gave it up. They broke up two months later, and he looks at my social media. We're not in contact, but according to my friend, a playlist on his Spotify was made as a birthday present to me. But I don't forgive him. I’m not angry at him for being loyal. I’m angry at him for thrusting me into this situation. I’m sure it wasn’t easy for him, but I was the one that suffered the greatest. He got to choose between two girls. His girlfriend is a victim too, but at least he tried to make things okay with her. And me? I had no intention of getting in the way of a relationship.

"So it's back So for a few weeks I've been wondering if I was going on a hypomanic episode. Ive been diagnosed bp 2 a year ago and since medicated, found a combo that works for me since november 22. Before that it was either really depressed and a bit of mixed and latest major hypomanic episode in summer 2021. 

So it had been a while and the thing is, I'm still very slow and sleep a lot, but compared to before when I slept 10-12 hours a night every 24h now I still sleep 10-12h but  I stay awake 24h+ multiple times a week.

Last friday I went to my psychiatrist and he asked me if I had any hints of impulsivity that could indicate hypomania, specifically spznding, sex and substance abuse (ya know the usual menu).
And I thought about it for a moment (in retrospect I was making up excuses that would make things logical) and then said no, just spending but for necessary stuff.

And here I am exactly a week later, wearing one of my two new wigs that arrived from aliexpress yesterday (I had only bought one super cheap one before), been smoking weed since monday and unpacking my new dildo in my newly fairyland garden themed decorated kitchen. Oh also received 150 bucks worth of beauty products (I've never done skincare before in my life except sheet masks and face creams from aldi).
For clarification I bought it all before seeing my psychiatrist and smoking again.

"New diagnosis, new medications (Abilify) and, of course, new questions Hi everyone! A little background here, before I ask any questions:

I've been struggling with mental health issues for approximately eight years now, and I am twenty-years-old. I was ""officially"" diagnosed with depression and anxiety in 2016, and started an anti-depressant. It worked alright at the start, but I continually seemed to be on some sort of a wave. Sometimes it was really, really bad, but then other times it seemed like everything was fine and I couldn't remember what it was like to be depressed.

Over time, this lead to me having more questions/concerns, and I spent some time doing research, and combined with some family history, this resulted in a personal hunch that I might have some form of bipolar disorder. I was pretty convinced I might have bipolar type II.

In the past few weeks, I finally found got enrolled with a Nurse Practitioner, and I was able to talk about the crushing depression I was feeling. At first, she decided I was experiencing severe depression, and sent me for blood tests before she planned to increase my Wellbutrin prescription. However, after my blood tests and talking some more, she did further screening. Based on the questionnaires I filled out and what we talked about, she and the doctor she works under confirmed that I have bipolar disorder. Despite the fact that I had been thinking about it, it was still a shock and I'm trying to get myself oriented in this new world.

Now, about new medications... Originally, I was going to be given lamotrigine 25mg twice daily, but the nurse practitioner had to consult the doctor to figure out if I would stay on my Wellbutrin at the same time or if I needed to be weaned off Wellbutrin first. In the end, they decided to keep me on Wellbutrin, add Abilify once daily at night, and if I reached the max dose of Abilify without optimal results, then they would add lamotrigine or another mood stabilizer.

So, last week I started Abilify at the 2mg dose. I take it at approximately 11:00pm, and then go to bed. However, I am having a tough time figuring out if my symptoms over the past few days are related, if they're typical, if they're likely to last, etc.

**Disclaimer: I know that you cannot provide medical advice, nor do I want medical advice from strangers on the Internet! I will be telling my nurse practitioner everything when I see her next, which will be on Wednesday of this week. I am just hoping to find some insight from other people who have taken Abilify and had similar experiences or who can provide additional reliable resources about Abilify, because I am struggling to find this information myself.**

* The nurse practitioner told me that they wanted me on Abilify to help me get better sleep. However, I don't find it makes it easy to sleep at all. The first night, I ended up being mostly awake until 7:30am, and then slept until 10:30am. The second night, I was awake until 1:45am and slept until 10:00am, and I had similar patterns the rest of the nights so far. Last night, I went to bed around 11:00pm as usual, and still was up until around 1:00am and woke up at 5:25am. I know that it takes a while for medications to really start working, but is this at all normal? This is almost worse than my sleep lately before I started it.
* I keep feeling so, so sick. The first day, I got a little bit queasy but didn't think much of it until I woke up and couldn't get out of bed at first because I felt so sick. Over the weekend, it made me so sick that I missed two shifts at work because I couldn't be bending over and lifting things up and walking around. I actually threw up once, but that was it. I did some research online and ended up making the decision to try taking gravol with it, but I know it can make me more drowsy and it's definitely causing dry mouth. I'm wondering if anyone else has taken Abilify and had this problem? Does it go away over time, and only come back when changing doses?
* Last night specifically, while I was trying to sleep, I experienced something I don't think I ever have before. I think I had some auditory hallucinations, I heard a repetitive noise, and then it was almost like people were talking despite the fact that I was alone with my boyfriend who was sleeping soundly. I've never had them before, and I don't understand where this would come from. Could it be from taking the Abilify? Or is it likely unrelated and coincidental?

"2 Week Rule Hi everyone!

I wanted to share something very helpful I learned from this subreddit.

While browsing one day, I saw someone say that they wait to go to the doctor until they've been having symptoms for 2 weeks. I started thinking about that, and it has helped me sooo much to internalize it.

Whenever I have a weird symptom (most days), I tell myself this: ""That's fine. Have something weird happen. I will go to the doctor in **two weeks** if it hasn't gotten any better. I will freak out then, but I'm not going to worry about it until it's time to book the appointment."" And believe it or not, symptoms almost always disappear within a day or two.....

I really hope that will help some of you, too. 

We're all in this together, I hope you have a calm day. &lt;3

"My strange two-sided life Hi I'm (25 M) new to to this subreddit and also to Reddit. I am not diagnosed with AvPD so far but I am able to relate to almost all the posts here. My parents are loving but the rest of the family on my dad's side is fucked up. My dad and his siblings are all suffering from some or the other disorder (Not all are diagnosed though because no one takes mental health seriously in my family). Everyone's super self-centred to the core. But it is the exact opposite on my mom's side. All of my mom's siblings, cousins and their kids get along great, while I feel like an outsider.

I was terribly bullied in middle school because I reflected the behaviour I saw back at home. Also because I had started watching porn. This went on for a few years. I learnt to build a shell around my myself to prevent people from seeing my true self. This shell has hardened to such an extent that nobody, I repeat, nobody has access to the person within. I have since been the ""mature"" kid in school and focussed primarily on academics. I made it to one of the best universities in my home country. 

A couple of years into university, I realised that I had a lot of ""friends"" but there was no one I could truly call a ""close"" friend. No one knew anything about me. I ""collaborated"" with a lot of people, both academically and in extracurricular activities but never got close enough to anyone. At that time I didn't think much of it, mainly because I was doing ""well"" according to the norm. I bagged some great internships and a well-paying job right out of college. 

Interestingly, this did not seem to affect my job. I performed exceptionally well and received great reviews, both in the technical and interpersonal front. But as you might have guessed it already, no one knew me out of work. Again, I ignored this and remained focussed on my work.

Then I decided to go for a master's and got accepted into one of the top graduate schools in the US. I have completed a term here. I started noticing this problem again during my first term after meeting and talking to people. It's not like I can't come up with things to talk about, but everything seems very superficial. There is no intimacy in any of the conversations. Also it feels like people behave differently when they talk to me.

I am not really interested in people's life and it is extremely exhausting to pretend otherwise. What's sad is that from the outside it looks as though I'm doing great and living the best life. There are people that look up to me and dream to achieve what I have achieved. But no one knows the truth, not even my parents.  

This post is the most candid I have ever been in my life. I don't reveal anything about myself to anyone. I have never been in a relationship and at this rate I'm afraid I will never be. I want to turn my life around before it's too late. I'm not sure how my family would react to therapy. I don't have enough money to fund it myself.

To end this vent, the details I have added in this post are not intended for bragging. I totally understand that people have suffered worse. Those are just to emphasize what an absolutely perfect, two-sided mess my life has become.",Personality disorder

"Is getting diagnosed with AvPD worth it? So correct me if I’m wrong about any of what I’m about to say. 

I noticed that the treatment for AvPD is cbt, which would be pretty much the standard treatment for a lot of mental health problems. 

So is it worth going through the process of being diagnosed with AvPD when you could just be diagnosed with something like say anxiety, and still get the same treatment options? 

Again, if I’m wrong don’t hesitate to correct me.

"Loss and depression go really well together I was doing well, on new medication, ping ponging a bit but never getting fully manic or fully depressed. Now, I knew I would be depressed for about two weeks after the end of the semester. The change in schedule always does it. But, during the second half of the semester, a good friend passed away. Afterwards, a good mutual friend started acting very strange, sometimes flat out mean. Our relationship was strained for about a month for reasons I don't fully know. He eventually blocked me online even though we had agreed that no matter what we would say goodbye as he was graduating. I was easily able to push it all away when I needed to during the semester. Now I just keep falling deeper and deeper as opposed to the normal brief depression. I can't think of my friend that passed without thinking of the one that blocked me and vice versa. They were my two go tos, the people I talked to every day and who made me feel secure. My world was turned upside down. Two of the very few people I would go to are gone. I don't know how to pull myself out this time and, honestly, I'm scared.",Bipolar

"How to get motivated to workout when depressed? Basically what it says in the title.

In theory, I know exercise helps with symptoms, and I like going to the gym when I'm not in the depths of depression. However, when I'm depressed, it's nearly impossible for me to motivate myself to go even semi-consistently. I get stuck doing nothing. I have trouble getting myself to put my gym clothes on, let alone actually walking there and completing a workout.

Also, I don't experience much, if any, of the usual pleasure I get after I work out (normally I'd feel better afterwards) when I'm depressed, so it's pretty hard to convince myself to do it because ""I'll feel better later"".

I've tried going for longer walks and other stuff, but if I'm honest dragging myself around my city in the rain alone with my dark thoughts doesn't help much. I go out most days with my dog, but when it gets bad I can't even begin to face it.

I know I sound like I'm being lazy and dramatic, but I'm serious. I really can't stand the idea of getting up, putting on my clothes, putting on my shoes, getting my dog ready, finding my keys, finding my phone, putting on my coat, locking up, going down the stairs in my apartment building, walking for 40 minutes, climbing the stairs again, then unlocking my door and going in. I get stuck between steps and find myself outside alone in the cold too sad to walk home, or staring at the stairs (pun) in my building unable to drag myself up them.

I get psychomotor slowing when I'm really bad.  It's physically difficult to walk. It feels like my body is made of lead. Sometimes it takes me over an hour to complete an activity that would normally take me half that time.

For people who've been able to push through this and get themselves to exercise, how?",Bipolar

I want to have sex with everyone, I’m attracted to everyone but my husband, I wish I’d never got married, never had a baby (though I love her so much) and my mind is SO FUCKING CONFLICTED. I met him 2 months after escaping an abusive relationship, slept with him the night we met, he moved in within 2 months, we were married in just over a year after finding out I was pregnant. If I didn’t know my child, I’d have wanted an abortion. But now I know I’m my baby, I can’t put her through adoption etc - I love her so much but have NO will power.

"I moved out. A friend of mine was talking to me about my family situation and I told him about how I wanted to put distance between me and them. He said that he might have some ideas and that we could work something out.

I've been in a new place now for five days. I have a roommate, he is cool. His work keeps me from seeing him very much, so I only have to deal with other people in small doses. 

The best thing is that I'm finally away from my relatives! It always feels weird when I say ""I miss you too"" over the phone because I don't miss them at all. I'm so happy to finally be freed of them!

People do keep telling me that it's natural for me to feel this way and that I'll miss them eventually, but I don't want to miss them. I had to go back earlier today to pick up some of my stuff, but I dreaded seeing anyone there. I left as soon as I could, and I guess I just don't know how to feel now. 

I still love them, I never didn't love my relatives, but I know they're not good for me. I am much better on my own. I guess I just feel guilty, like I owe them something. Part of me wants to go back and try to fix them, but I have to keep reminding myself that I can't do that, and that they're not my responsibility. 

So, I'm determined to not go back for as long as possible. The only reason I'd go back now is to get my bike, but I can be without that for a while. Otherwise, I'm done belonging to them. I am my own person now, and I'm slowly getting to like who I'm becoming.

"Rabies HA is wrecking me Hey all. So I've been struggling with HA for years now but was really doing a lot better, almost 3 months with no major scares or full on panic attacks or anything. Then a couple days ago I got hit like a ton of bricks. I haven't been able to focus on or accomplish anything for days now and could really use some perspective.

About three months ago I was bitten on the leg by a small dog while out on a run. It was a small bite, barely broke the skin, and it turned out to be my neighbor's dog. She was very understanding and even emailed me the dog's vaccination records. I also checked in last week and the dog is still alive and well.

Despite this, I started getting symptoms the other day and I cannot. Stop. Freaking. Out. I keep convincing myself I'm getting pain or tingling near the bite site, plus I have all my usual anxiety symptoms again (nausea, insomnia, loss of appetite, brain fog) which are all signs of rabies onset. I've done all the research, I know there's basically no chance of getting rabies from an animal that's still alive weeks later but nothing will put my mind at ease.

"Anyone else from a minority community, nationality, ethnic group, religion, or race and feel like an outcast everywhere? Apart from moving many times during childhood and teenage years I have one parent who was Jewish and one who was Hispanic/Puerto Rican. They divorced when I was young (Stevie Wonder could see that one coming) and as a result I never felt like I belonged with any community. I never learned Spanish, never really learned all that much about being Jewish or Puerto Rican (my mother was Americanized) except the basic stuff. I was also too isolated to feel like a belonged to the average American culture in general and never really picked up on all the pop-culture that went along with it. I've always felt like an outcast and outsider partly because of this. Although at the same time I feel like I'm a failure/coward because I see many people who are part of a minority group who are able to handle themselves just fine and I'm white on top of that so I didn't really have it that hard. You can tell I may be Jewish because of some of my facial features (lol) and I was sometimes teased and bullied in school/work because of it but it's never been as bad as someone who is for example dark skinned (in a western country) and has a foreign accent.

"it is been pretty obvious for a year or so, about where I am headed. I never chose to discipline myself, I never chose to succeed academically in high school (where I am currently at as a junior) since I have never really put in any significant effort into my courses, and ultimately, I have come to terms with failing in life and living in absolute shambles - like, taking up some dead-end job like McDonald's or Applebee's for the rest of my life, with a wage that barely supports myself. I have also happened to act like a massive dick to my parents and my older sister - both of which have endlessly nagged and lectured me whilst pushing me into opportunities such as tutoring for improving my grades, and some math contests at a university I live close to. I do not think they will regret seeing me go after countless shouting matches, fistfights, and instances of broken furniture, - all of which are a product of my uncontrollable fits of rage stemming from my recklessness, hatred, and ignorance towards them. I truly think that, while they still try to made amends for myself by lecturing me and giving me chances to improve my prospects for my future, they really should not care about this little piece of 16 year-old privileged shit anymore, because I just will not listen. Everything I have done in my life, whether it be positive (if there is any I could genuinely think of) or negative (there *is* plenty that I could think of here), is the result of my own actions, where I have continuously failed to realize the consequences of my own actions. that is all I have to say.

"HA strikes again... So... I’m not looking for reassurance or diagnosis or anything really I guess. But I just had to share with some people who might understand.

I have a long history of health anxiety. Can’t get a cold without convincing myself I might be dieing. Frequent rabies scares. I’ve convinced myself something was seriously wrong a couple times a month for years. I’ve mostly talked myself out of seeing a doctor because I know it’s just anxiety and I don’t want doctors to think I’m crazy or wasting their time.

A few days ago though... I found a lump under the skin above my right rib cage. So I did the logical thing and poked around for a lump on my left side... I thought maybe I felt a smaller similar lump and talked myself off the ledge.

But now I can actually see a lump on my right side in the mirror. And when I prod around, it feels like there might be a cluster of small lumps (only one is visible though).

So... of course I’m worried it might be cancer although Dr. Google tells me there’s all sorts of benign explanations.

I’m currently talking myself into seeing a doctor for peace of mind. But I hate the doubt telling me this is anxiety and I’ll be wasting the doctor’s time. I’m terrified the doctor will label me with hypochondria.

"Can't stop obsessing.. Any tips? Sorry if this is a little long, but I'm new here and desperately looking for some advice. Plus it kinda helps to get it all off my chest.. 

I've been struggling with health anxiety for a little while now, and although I keep kidding myself that I'm in control, I don't feel very in control. I can't stop the constant worrying and obsessing.

It all started just over a year ago, when I spent a week in hospital. I'm not going to go into detail as to why, as I don't want to trigger anyone else's anxiety... But it wasn't a great week.

Since then, I've been fine. I have ibs, which is unfortunate as the symptoms I get seem to really trigger my anxiety. But that's the most serious problem I have. A few other minor things, asthma, skin problems, but nothing unmanageable.

I noticed my anxiety levels shifting around a year on from my hospital stay. Think it must have just been on my mind, then I had a really bad ibs flare up that threw me. Was off my food, had no energy and lots of other unpleasant things.

Ibs is more under control now, but my anxiety is not. I feel anxious in general, have quite a foggy head alot of the time, don't really feel like myself, don't want to do much, getting tired out easy, feel like crying alot. But mostly I'm struggling because I can't stop obsessing about every little thing wrong with me.

The slightest cramp or ache sends me spiraling into a panic. I can't stop googling things to find out if there is something wrong with me. Even though I don't really have any ongoing symptoms and they are more one offs. Can't stop poking and prodding looking for lumps or enlarged lymph nodes.

Any time I find the tiniest little lump (found one or two in the fat layer on my stomach) I obsess. Can't seem to stop looking for it to see if I can find it again. Most of the time I can't, any if I find anything it's tiny so logically I know it's nothing to worry about. But I just can't stop.

It really feels like it's taking over. I just feel like I'm stuck in an endless obsessive cycle of prodding, being hyper aware of every tiny sensation, looking for things wrong with me a constantly googling.

It's got to the point that when I have a nice symptom free day, I find myself looking for something that's wrong with me as I feel like i can't trust that I'm actually ok.

Anyone got any advice, or been in a similar situation? This isn't something I find easy to open up about, but I'm scared it's going to completely consume me if I don't do something. ",Anxiety

"Fighting the stigma against medicating mental illness so people like me don't wait forever to get help Hey there! I'm bipolar and have had a lot of success with lamotrigine, but it took me a really long time to start taking it because there's such an intense stigma around medicating mental illnesses. I kind of assumed I would lose all sense of self if I took them, and I wish I didn't have that feeling for so long (over a decade).

So I started up a project called Wear Your Meds recently to try and help other people not feel that way. Basically it's a series of 1"" buttons, and each button shows a commonly-prescribed mental illness medication. Anyone who wears one of these buttons is signaling that they’re open to sharing their personal story of how the medication helped. It's also a show of solidarity because sometimes it can feel like no one else you know is on meds. I'm hoping some people on here would be into it. More info is at wearyourmeds.com",Bipolar

"Breaking up with boyfriend of two years because of my anxiety I (25f) have been dating my boyfriend (33m) for two years now. We haven’t really had any problems until my anxiety started worsening about 4 months ago. I’ve had anxiety and depression since middle school and was officially diagnosed with ADHD in January. My anxiety and depression have been at a low for a few years now, which I definitely took for granted. I’m on a couple different antidepressants and got them to a good level. 

About 4 months ago, my anxiety started worsening for no discernible reason. Okay, great, I’m working with my therapist on it and talking to my psychiatrist about it, but my overall mental health is still going downhill. My boyfriend, luckily for him, has never struggled with mental health and has no idea how to relate to me or support me. I’ve been working really hard to communicate with him about how I’m feeling and what I need, but he really just ignores it. 

For example, in January we were out of the country for my work and planned on staying a couple extra nights to make a vacation out of it. Traveling generally heightens my anxiety, especially international travel. A lot of little things happened (including a couple small actions he made) one day that led to an anxiety attack, and he basically ignored the fact that it was happening. A couple hours after I came down from the attack and I had taken a cold shower and eaten a little bit, I talked to him about it a bit. I said “you can correct me if I’m wrong, but it seems like you don’t know how to respond or support me when I’m having really bad anxiety moments like this,” he said yeah that’s true, so I asked if it would be helpful if I told him a couple things that help when I’m really struggling. He agreed, so I said a few things like getting me some cold water, giving me a hug/holding me, taking a walk with me if that’s an available option, things like that. He said he could work with that. Over the past two or so months since then, I’ve had a few anxiety attacks similar to the one I had in January, and every time he basically ignores my anxiety. I’ve repeated my request a couple times, but it doesn’t make any difference. (There are a lot of other similar issues that have been going on as well.) 

Over the weekend, we had a very short conversation (probably 5 minutes max) and half of it was silence because neither of us knew what to say. (None of this is necessarily in order, I really don’t remember the order because it was really emotionally charged and kind of upsetting.) I said I wanted to try to make it work. I asked him if he wanted to try to make it work, and his response was “I want you to be happy, and I don’t want to be taking that from you whether it’s because I’m not putting the effort in or unable to support you, or something else.” Which didn’t actually answer my question (I guess it did in a roundabout way, though). I also asked if he still loved me, and he paused for what felt like forever before saying “yes.” 

I’ve spent more time crying in the past two weeks than I have my entire life before this. 

I’ve been thinking about our relationship a lot over the past couple months. He’s not a very talkative person in general. If there’s an issue, he ignores it completely or makes passive remarks and doesn’t actually bring it up. I feel like not only am I the only one that tries to open communication lines, but that I’m not getting my needs met also. 

I’ve talked to my therapist about it a bunch, and I think I’ve pretty much made my decision: I’m going to break up with him and work on my mental health. 

It feels terrible sitting on this, knowing the relationship is coming to an end. I have some major events coming up at work this week (including a 4 day long audit that I’m in charge of) so I’m basically trying to balance holding off for as long as possible (I.e. the end of the week) and being anxious and miserable about it and having that hard conversation now and being a different kind of upset and not able to focus at work. Either way, I’m not going to be able to be completely mentally present at work, I’m just trying to figure out what would be best for me and also respectful to my partner. 

I’m struggling with feeling like I’m broken and impossible to love because of my anxiety. I know that’s not actually the case, but it sure feels that way. 

Anyway, thank you for listening. All my family lives out of state and I only have a couple friends, none of which I really talk about deep stuff like this with. I just want a hug. 

I apologize for the long post, I just wanted to get it off my chest.",Anxiety

"I’m so truly exhausted. I don’t know why my brain is the way it is anymore and it hurts. I’m struggling so much. Here’s my story if you want to stick around to read it. Last year, about this same time I got Covid, probably the worst thing I have ever gone through in my entire life, besides the horrible sickness part, somehow it sparked some sort of new anxiety in me. Before it I never experienced anxiety like I do now, but somehow it came on painfully out of no where. Panic attacks more than once a day, unable to control my thoughts, horrible intrusive thoughts, nightmares, insomnia, constant fidgeting &amp; some anger/irritability for no reason at all. 
After a month or two from healing from Covid (Covid long haul) I was getting better, no more panic attacks, able to drive, get out and be happy. I was okay, till now. One night I woke up a little too early so I decided to stay up instead of falling back asleep for three or so hours, and boom it was back. My mind went straight back to the anxiety, the irritability and pain as before but without the anxiety.
It’s been a few weeks or so now since it started and I feel so tired and mentally drained.
I started some anxiety meds (Buspirone 5mg 2x) and haven’t seen a massive amount of change yet.

"I can't decide about school... The second semester just started and idk what to do... I haven't been to school since before Christmas and right now my goals are to take a shower every week and get through the day. I was gone for some time last semester as well and will probably not get a grade in a few classes. This week I met with my school counselor, main teacher and my ""psychologist"" about school. I'm currently being evaluated for bipolar but it seems pretty clear that I'm going to be put on some medication at least, which is kind of terrifying. Though it will be some time until then. 

So, my options are to either take the rest of the school year off and start this autumn redoing my school year, or take 3 classes now and the rest next year. Everyone excepts me to have an answer, but I don't. I can't even answer simple questions like ""What do you want to eat?"". I wish somebody would just tell me even though I know I have to decide myself. I just can't seem to care. I could barely speak and focus throughout the meeting and my mom ended up speaking mostly. The psychologist brought up shortly how I was last time we talked and I felt shameful for how I had acted. I talked with my brother about how things have been lately and he could kind of relate to my ""ups"", only it's from his experiences with drugs. I didn't think it was that bad and it seems he thought he was experiencing a milder version of what I was experiencing. That hit me. 

Right now it's like I'm taking a look into myself looking at things that seem new to me and all of this is overwhelming and having to evaluate myself is freaky. Idk if school thrown into the mix will help, and now my whole class knows I struggle mentally (in Norway we have a main class that take certain subjects together). I've also been oversharing with some people and I feel like everyone is looking at me differently. I feel like a disease and a pushover. I'm making everything worse and being distant to everyone but I can't help it. Mom deserves better than me. Though it would maybe be better to take 3 classes now instead of everything next year. The thing is that I haven't been able to concentrate at all. Up or down. When I was up there was just too much noise in my head and I had too many other plans. I couldn't even concentrate on what I wanted to do and kept jumping between a lot of things. Still I was 100% sure I could catch up to everything in a couple days which didn't happen. I ended up not sleeping making a workout schedule that was ridiculous, especially for someone who doesn't excercise, drinking a lot of Bailey's to calm down (didn't work) even though I rarely drink, then jogging and working out. Then turning really suicidal and lashing out for 2-3 days before becoming numb. I hate that I want to live yet die so badly at the same time. But. This wasn't what I was going to talk about.

I am trying to make a checklist of things to do to avoid the deepest pits of depression - or at least mitigate the damage done when in that hole. Just a list of things to maintain or have someone else help me (or you) maintain to reduce the impact of those times - if they cannot be avoided entirely. Thought some of you might have some ideas I have not thought of. So far I have: 1. Are you gaming too much? (I tend to use games to avoid my problems)2. Have you been drinking enough water? 3. Do you need a haircut? (When my hair gets long I tend to let go of all my other grooming which just makes everything worse)4. Have you done the laundry?5. Is there plenty of food in the house? (If I do not have easily accessible food in bad times I either will not eat or will eat terribly unhealthy food)it is a start. I am curious what things you notice in your own life that are markers for you of mental health slipping. Please comment. Mental health maintenance checklist,Depression

"I think I'm in the middle of a nervous breakdown. I've never had one before. Thoughts, and suggestions greatly appreciated. This is going to be super long, but I would really appreciate someone out there taking the time to read it...

I've been working a relatively stressful job for the last four years. The stress was manageable until about a year ago when I was given the responsibility of managing a global team of systems administrators in the US, Hungary and India that all work to give 24/7 coverage to my company. I can't go into specifics of our work, but I can say that we are an extremely important team. There are a lot of reasons behind why I have become increasingly stressed out, the main one being that I have personally been the only point of failure for the whole thing for almost the entire year. I can't take a day off, or sometimes even an hour off without someone from like 14 time zones away trying to escalate something to me, or my boss of they can't reach me directly. Before this past week, I had taken one scheduled day off, and I still got a call from my boss asking to get people online for an outage.

Let me say, my boss is amazing. She is the best example of leadership I've ever had in any job, and I've worked IT for like 25 years. She just has a very demanding job role also, and I am in a spot where I'm kind of working 4-5 different full time job roles, and one of those job roles requires that I get people online for outages which are not at all related to the global team I'm responsible for. 

The past few months, people have increasingly seen that I'm getting more and more stressed to the point where I had a chat with HR because I had started working like 75+ hour weeks sometimes until 2am. I basically said that ""because of how I've been forced to set this whole team up within the guidelines I'm given by upper management (not my direct boss), nobody else has time to work this project, so if I don't do the work myself, it can't get done."" 

I mean, everyone saw it coming including me. Then last week happened. I was supposed to have Friday off as a normal day because leadership rotates Sundays for the other full time job role apart from the project, so every time I work a Sunday, I get the following Friday off. We had a major issue happen on Thursday which we knew would carry into this coming weekend, so I was going to cancel both my Friday off and the planned time I had on the calendar for like three months from Wednesday - Sunday this week because I knew everything would get messed up if I didn't. 

Well, I decided, this was a chance for me to test if other parts of leadership can actually do their jobs. Instead of canceling my time off like I have literally every other time something like this has happened the last year, I decided to take it. However, I gave my peers the plan of what needed to happen from Friday - Sunday, laid out for them completely, and all but spoonfed them. I went into it trying to just expect people to do their jobs. All they had to do was say ""Ok, we have the plan, here's this person who can do this thing that needs to get done, I'll have them do it..."" I also knew it wasn't going to happen like that. I knew... I knew that come Sunday evening, nothing would get done. So, I went Friday without checking my work phone. I went Saturday without checking my work phone. Then Sunday rolled around, and I finally checked... sure enough, even though my peers had the plan, it wasn't executed. I had to log in on Sunday to quickly get the right weekend people on it, and because things weren't executed on time during Friday/Saturday like I said they needed to be, it caused two huge outages like twelve time zones away. 

I went into work on Monday morning completely distraught. I met with my directs under me basically telling them that what happened is not their fault, and an effect of ineffective leadership which I'm largely responsible for. I sat there for a good 45 minutes apologizing to them, telling them what I plan to do going forward, and also commiserating because I was really as stressed as they were about it.

During that talk, something broke in me, I think. Like, I had known that I was the sole failure point globally, but I was fine with that as long as I had people who could simply just organize whatever plan I gave them. I gave them that plan on Thursday, trying to clear things off my plate as I have been advised to do by my boss and HR, just expecting them to do basically the bare minimum, and they weren't capable of executing. I finally actually felt the full weight of being the sole failure point of global operations, and it crushed down on me so hard that I could barely breathe. 

I went to my boss after that meeting, and told her I had to leave for the day, but I would be back the next day. I took Monday off, almost too full of anxiety to even drive home, but made it then just watched movies I'd seen a hundred times already all day because I couldn't process any new information. I felt alright though, like at the end of it I had a sense of purpose, and renewed motivation. I woke up Tuesday completely ready to rock it at work, but as soon as I pulled out of the parking lot, I started to get a feeling I've only ever felt once before. I hopped on the highway, and the closer I got to work, the more I felt it. Then, it happened. I had a panic attack. I had to pull off the highway to turn around to go home. The second I had my car going back the other way, I felt like I could breathe even though I was still having heart palpitations, tunnel vision, numb tongue, etc. I got home, called my boss, and was straight up with her stating I had a panic attack on my way in, and I would not be making it. 

Then came yesterday. I had to make a five hour drive back to my hometown for the plans I had made for the aforementioned scheduled time off. I was happy, looking forward to it, couldn't wait to get back, but as soon as I got on the highway, the dread set in. The obsessive thoughts set in. I spent the next five hours in panic attack mode to the point where I don't know how I actually drove the car. All I wanted to do was get home, so I kept going, but I stopped like six times to re-center myself on a trip that I don't generally even stop on once.

I got here, took a breath, sat down for a bit, and things were okay. But ever since, it's been a mixed bag of being okay for a while, then like 30-60 minutes of panic attack... then being okay again, then another panic attack. Thankfully, I spent today playing golf with my family which is what I had been looking so forward to, but it took like an hour for me to come into reality when we first started out. 

Then I got back, took a nap, and woke up in a panic attack about an hour later. 

Like, this is not at all my natural state. I am normally a very chill person who handles stress immensely well. I have had one panic attack before during a very difficult time, but I've never had multiples of them, and I've most certainly never had a nervous breakdown... but I think that's where I am. I've tried talking to my family, but none of them really understand because none of them has ever really had this kind of breakdown. General depression, anxiety, and that stuff, so they can relate (haha, family can relate...) on that level, but it's like I can barely be a functioning human. That's what they can't relate with. 

That's why I decided to post here hoping that someone else can relate, and just let me know this is going to end at some point. I'm not suicidal, or anything, I'll suffer through whatever I have to suffer though, I just need to have a light at the end of the tunnel.

Have you ever seen Se7en? You know that part where they find the guy Kevin Spacey had been keeping alive for a year, and the doctor said ""If I were to shine a light in his eyes right now, he'd die of the stress...""? That's where I feel like I am. Like any source of any stress from anywhere that raises my adrenaline whatsoever just throws me into a panic attack. I am trying to deal, but it's difficult feeling like there's no end in sight because I've never experienced this before so I don't know what to expect.

I have just been through this every step of the way knowing I am going to be lonely through it and I wish I could split myself and give myself a hug. I would just hold myself because no one has ever done that for me, listen to myself and like I said hug myself. Why cannot I have one single person imagine what I am going through, guess I am just not worth it. And to make things worse my mom totally ignores me and what I am going through so I literally have no one, I guess well just see where this ends up. I hope that is it.

"i was a real person… and then i ruined everything went through my facebook conversations from years ago today and i got so emotional. i used to speak to so many people. and i sounded so neurotypical. a lot of the messages from these ppl were rlly sweet 

i started crying bc i couldn’t believe there was a time when people actually loved me. i’m so used to people being disgusted /repulsed by me. like no one i’ve met in the past few years has actually liked me 

i used to be real - i had hopes, dreams, stories to share. i was physically attractive and (moderately) smart. 

it all went downhill when i moved abroad for college. i’ve always struggled socially so when i realized that i didn’t have to talk to ppl to survive, i isolated myself 

4 years later and i’m a completely different person. there is nothing inside me. i’m empty. just a lifeless being waiting for death. i don’t recognize the girl that wrote those texts. 

my cognitive abilities have significantly declined - i used to write so well and now i can’t even string a coherent sentence together. i’m so negative and hateful. i have zero empathy. i cannot carry a conversation anymore. i’m constantly disassociated from reality. i haven’t had friends in years. the only people i talk to are my parents and my grandma

"Do you guys ever wonder why you couldn’t have just had a normal life like everyone else? My life was normal until my father died at 7 and my mom left at 9. I experienced childhood trauma, physical abuse, emotional abuse, verbal abuse, and neglect by the people that raised me. Not only that, I come from a strict religious immigrant family so along with all those issues, I was never allowed to leave the house much. My family also never went out and did anything and they also never showed me any love or affection.

This was my life growing up until I finally moved out at 22. I’ve since been doing better for myself as I’ve graduated college and have a career now. But the damage was so severe that I don’t think I’ll ever fully recover. My upbringing made me lonely that I never had many friends. Verbal abuse made me mute and unable to talk back so I can’t talk with cluttering. I do not have much confidence or self esteem. I still do this day don’t have many friends or much of a social life. I also have a hard time dating and at 28 still have not hooked up with a girl outside is kissing and making out.

I look at my life and the look at everyone else. They all had loving caring parents, siblings to play with, and grew up with all the love and compassion in the world. They have many friends, they have boyfriends, they have girlfriends, they don’t have speech issues, etc. They just seem to be able to live life normally unlike me.

I did nothing wrong to deserve the things that happened to me as a kid as all of it out of out my control. But sometimes I ask myself, why me? Just why? I was given only one life on this planet, why did my life go like this? Why does everyone else get love and compassion while I got nothing but misery?",Personality disorder

I thought I was stable for a day or so because I was getting shit done, but not going as crazy as usual on a hypo episode. But today... oy! I got like zero sleep, and am currently wide-awake writing this at 3am, got up and ran some errands that i ususally do with my husband alone because I was annoyed that he was still tired. Like I wanted to kick him in the head because he was still asleep. And in the car I randomly started crying and couldn't stop until i started screaming. When i stopped screaming, I began to cry again - this went on for some time.

"Super anxious Hi everyone. So, Im freaking out right now. I'm really scared that I have HIV. I moved to a big city at the beginning of the fall for college, and I decided to try hooking up. However, it was always an instinct to use a condom when participating in sex. I've always topped too. But, I stopped after a couple months because I felt like I was doing too much. But, about a month ago, I hooked up with another dude. I've topped every dude I've had anal with and I've used a condom every time. However, I'm so scared that I have contracted HIV. I keep looking up the risks and everything. From information to ""use condoms"" to ""condoms don't always work,"" my anxiety has skyrocketed. As I type this, my cheeks and neck are red hot causing me to think I have a fever. It's more of a deep blushing feeling because my face is only affected along with my arms. But when I tell myself I'm good, my cheeks go back to normal causing me to think I'm jinxing myself. In addition, I feel a little more tired than usual.

I'm just so scared. I protected myself but I don't know if something went wrong along the way. I don't recall a condom breaking but sometimes the other dude would give the condom to me, and Im scared that they might have done something to it. I'm just so frightened. I tell myself that I should go to a nearby clinic and get tested, but what if something results that makes me fall into a depression. The semester isn't over and my life would completely change.

"A great, simple technique for coping with health anxiety (I posted this as a comment to another thread about panic attacks, but thought it warranted its own post. It's adapted for anxiety from a similar method in *Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy*, a book on depression by David D. Burns, M.D.)

***************

If you struggle with health anxiety (or any kind of anxiety really), give this a try the next time your worries start to get the better of you. I do it in an Excel spreadsheet, but a notebook works fine too.


**The Three-Column Technique**
 


**Column 1: Fear**
 
In this column, write down whatever's freaking you out at the moment: ""I'm worried I'll have a heart attack out of nowhere"" or ""What if someone took what I said at yesterday's meeting the wrong way?""

**Column 2: What triggered it**
 
Write down what you were thinking, feeling or doing when you started down your current worry spiral. For example, ""I felt a skipped heartbeat"" or ""I felt my lymph nodes and they seemed a little swollen."" Over time, some triggers will appear more often in your notes than others, helping you spot habits that get you into trouble.

**Column 3: Real talk**
 
Normally, you only think of the worst-case scenario. This is your chance to do the opposite: write down every reason you can think of that you'll be absolutely fine - which, by the way, are *exponentially more realistic scenarios*. Go nuts; the more you write, the better you'll feel. 

For example, my scariest symptoms are skipped heartbeats, so when I feel one, I list points like these:


 * Skipped heartbeats are perfectly normal; most people have them and don't even notice


 * Some people experience thousands of skipped beats a day and are perfectly healthy


 * You already met with a cardiologist, and she gave you a clean bill of health


 * Skipped beats are a very common side effect of anxiety - it's much more likely anxiety is the cause than some rare heart defect


 * This aside, I have zero symptoms of an underlying heart issue


  ...and on and on.

 
The more you use this technique, the more you'll notice the same fears and triggers popping up over and over again. And when you see that, you'll see how often you worry about the same thing - and how your worst fears are never, ever realized.

 
Hope this helps, stay strong!",Anxiety

after several suicidal attempts my last one was 9 months ago, not gonna go into details of how i did it but i had a very bad inflammation and stomach ache! did go to the hospital for “being sick for no reason”, docs told me that my test all came back fine and i should just rest (not really sure how but i was glad). 

in the next days i had the worst chest pain i’ve ever experienced and i definitely thought i was gonna have a heart attack and die, one day it got really bad and my heart raced like crazy and i was shaking but no one was around and after a couple of minutes i was ok. i guess it was a panic attack (never had one before) so i brushed it off like nothing happened. 


in the next months i have been having these weird chest pain i thought i had a problem with my heart, but as days went by i noticed that the pain gets so much worst when i think about certain things. i’ve done so much to get rid of the pain yet it seems like it only gets worst.

i was watching a video on youtube the other day about a medical case and when they started to describe the symptoms that the patient had I HAD THE WORST CHEST PAIN SO FAR!! my heart was racing and my chest tightened i couldn’t breathe! 

googled it and got an “anxiety test”, idk what to do. it really fucked me up i thought i was crazy.

"Help with appetite under extreme acute stress I'm moving interstate in 2 weeks, have had a lot happen in my life over the past 4 months, zero support where I currently live and I'm under extreme stress that's destroyed my appetite completely.

"Up and down So, my health anxiety focuses on getting pregnant: I’m terrified of it, don’t ever want to be (I’m 20) and no doctor will tie my tubes. I thought either my contraceptive implant was broken, i would do pregnancy tests and not trust the result or go digging through the bin for them, I didn’t trust a blood test, I thought every twinge in my body was a symptom. I thought I saw signs everywhere telling me I was pregnant.

Then, last week, after 3 CBT sessions, upping my anti depressants and travelling home to see my parents for the first time in 4 weeks, I had the first ‘good’ week since September. No tests, no doctor visits, plenty of exercise, could snap myself out of any dangerous thought patterns. No googling! I was so happy and proud. I even had sex for the first time in 4 months with my boyfriend. 

Then, on Saturday morning, my boyfriend accidentally grabbed my arm implant. Since then, I feel like I’ve spiralled back of control after just one week of happiness. I’ve resisted doing a test so far, but I swear my implant is broken even after seeing a nurse, I’m symptom spotting, googling, crying etc. My techniques to cope aren’t working.

I've gone over this at least a hundred times, like tonight, even if I get approved they have a new 90 day minimum waiting period so it will be a while regardless. I have to time to think which leads to all fun ideas of Wiley coyote jumping off my balcony and hitting the concrete awning over the front entrance, 12 stories might kill ol' Wiley, maybe, or leave him in agonizing pain, wishing for death. Imagine holding that little sign up to the camera, but it's a little suicide note saying goodbye to no one. Haha

But I'm pretty confident I'm going to get approved, I meet very criteria, I've tried all the required mental health options, counselling, therapy, community services, etc.  I don't have any psychological supports, I am alone. That's more than half the reason I want to go, this condition, this brain, it makes it so I will always be alone. The loneliness, knowing you can never and never will escape, you'll avoid every chance you have. But the pain doesn't have to be forever, I don't have to keep suffering, and if I don't get approved jokes on them. I don't need approval to kill myself, I just know I'm going to fuck it up anyway. Ending up with my ankles snapped off, trying to crack my skull open on the concrete but too fucking weak to get the pressure. I couldn't do it if I tried, not because I don't want too. 

I want too, I want too so bad, that's why I'm applying for Maid, but I need to do it. But I will fail because I always fail. I'll avoid because i always avoid. I'll pity myself and feel bad and get fucked up and cry and hurt myself and tomorrow will happen and my credit card will get more maxed out and death will come knocking again saying TODAY IS THE DAY DO IT DO IT FUCKING DO IT PLEASE DO IT.  Constantly. That's my brain, thousands of times a day screaming kill yourself. I love saying slit your wrists over and over again. Making tea, I should slip my fucking wrists, dum dum dum please slit your wrists. I don't even have a good knife, I just say it for some reason to myself.

"I have been taking antidepressants for 2 months now. My psychiatrist prescribed me milnacipran (50 mg) and I am not sure if its working or not. My sleep schedule has gotten a lot better, I started eating and drinking water regularly in 2 weeks after I started taking my meds. that is a big step forward (obviously) but I have absolutely no energy and fail to do the simplest tasks around the house, I cannot leave my bed and force myself to even go get groceries. Sometimes depression hits me so bad that I totally stop talking to my closest friends and family members. Social withdrawal used to give me enough emotional strength to bounce back into life, now it only makes things worse. It does not feel like much has changed and I am paralysed with fear that my entire life will be as miserable and unbearable as it is right now. Is it too early to see any results from meds? I am going to see my psychiatrist soon and of course I plan on discussing this situation in detail, but I thought it would be nice to get some personal experiences from people. I really do not know how I pulled through my uni finals on 0 energy and motivation. Everything is a struggle. I do not even know if such a life is worth living at all. P. S.

"This is not a cry for help or a pity party post, but I am looking for input on whoever reads the post and has any insight on ECT or TMS therapy...I am not doing well mentally. I have not been for a long, long time. With MDD (Unipolar) among other things such as GAD and PTSD, the low cycles come in waves, but the highs are always mild and do not always seem to last all that long.I have been told countless times that I am such a negative person, I complain a lot, or I never seem like I am having fun. I get blamed for a mental health disorder that I have been battling for years and have tried countless medications, therapists, psychiatrists, holistic supplements, meditation, testosterone therapy, to name the healthy and positive actions I have taken. I have also been dependent on alcohol and drugs, used sex and intimacy as a means of feeling better about myself, self-harm, attempted suicide for the negatives...Truth is, I really want to live and be happy and enjoy my life, but sometimes, especially lately, every day seems like an uphill battle, every day I have to fight myself just to get out of bed in the morning and go to work (and I have a good job and am doing well financially), every day, I worry that my mental illness is pushing people away in my life (fact: it has), every day I worry that I am ruining my relationship because of my inability to manage my emotions and mental health issues. I want so desperately to not feel like this anymore and I am running out of options that I have not already tried.I started looking into ECT (Electro-convulsive therapy) treatment as a last resort for treating my mental health issues and I was nervous about the risks associated (such as retrograde amnesia). I do not want to risk zapping away memories in my brain and losing part of who I am, but had decided to start looking into it as all else has failed so far. I was very fortunate to find that there is a safer alternative that is only available medically here in Austin. TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation) is a safer alternative to ECT with less side effects and is less intrusive.I was worried about ECT because these treatments are a multi-week long process and ECT makes you lose short term memory temporarily and you need someone to pick you up and drop you off from the clinic, and it would have meant I would be unlikely able to work during the process. TMS does not have this same effect and I would be able to do it more independently and still be able to work.If I am being honest, I am still nervous about all of it. I have my first TMS consultation this afternoon. I want my brain to be healthy again, I want to be able to enjoy my life. I am so blessed to have the people in my life that I do, but I am just as frustrated at my lack of progress as anybody else who knows me and has had to deal with me. It certainly sucks so fucking much to always be told that I am not doing enough, that I create my own situation. If I have learned anything throughout all of this is that I do not have control over my emotions, I do not have control over my well-being, I do not have control over my life. But I want to. And I am getting to that point where maybe I do need it all zapped away and start afresh.

The worst of these was a doc in college who insisted I needed to take high-dose Adderall which turned me into a 95 pound skeleton of a crackhead.  Depression meds made me a zombie.

My psychiatrist now is (sort of) working in conjunction with my therapist.  I say sort of because after therapist sent me to psych for treatment for ""mood disorder"", he prescribed for ADHD.  I wasn't really surprised, but had tried to explain to him in office that I was a hot mess because I was travelling across the country the next day, and that I was nervous because it was my first time meeting him.  Of course I couldn't concentrate and was fidgety and talking fast. :\

Anyway, those meds made me feel awful, so after taking them for a month, I stopped.  Yesterday he prescribed Lamictal, and today is my first day taking it.  What can I expect?  how has it helped any of you?  Were the side effects bad?  I am also taking Trazodone, given to me by my primary doc for sleep issues.

When I’m depressed I am in contact with my feelings, I’m completely focused on what’s happening inside of me instead of outside of me 2. When I’m “happy” I’m not in contact if my feelings, I get my happiness from external factor, in contrast of when I’m depressed I get my sadness from internal factors.

"How do you cope with bad stool anxiety? (Gross?) I've been struggling with this particular health anxiety for some months now.

I've been suffering heavily from health anxiety for 9 months now. But this isn't some muscle ache or dizziness I can just ignore.

The stool keeps going from having weeks where it's too soft, to weeks where it's semi back to normal. Sometimes I see small red...bits? in it. 

When I went to my doctor about it the first time, I performed a couple of feces tests. I got a slightly elevated white blood cell count on one of them.

Then like 2 months ago I cried hysterically because I started dripping fresh red blood after a visit. 

Doctor discovered that there was a small hemorroid near the opening. I've done more tests much later on, so far they've come out negative, I have one more test I need to do that is quite time consuming. 

He assured me that it's way too rare that it can be colon cancer (I'm 20 and have no history) and that he sees no real reason to worry.

But I'm relapsing again two weeks after feeling fine about it. I got a very small amount of blood. I know it's much more likely that it was a tear cause it hurt quite a bit coming out. But it awakened the beast from it's slumber...

I just don't know how to ignore stuff like this and carry on. It's not like a muscle pain which can be anything and ignored. It's too visual and clear to my eyes.

Some of those people do stuff together I came to know but not once was I asked to join. And I have a ""best friend"" who‘s just weird.

I'm a strong believer in God although I must admit I could do a better job in seeking the father. I just don't know what to do. My chest pains are getting stronger and more painful.

"Health anxiety following stomach flu, anyone else? I have moderate to severe health anxiety especially when I’m sick, then it’s pretty severe. 

About 6 days ago I came down with a stomach virus and was violently puking and had water like diarrhea (sorry if TMI). By day 3 I was no longer feeling the nausea or diarrhea, but have a general sense of being unwell/dehydrated/drained.

"Terrified I have myocarditis and will suddenly die soon I've been suffering cold-like viral symptoms for the last 10 days, and I'm terrified the virus will attack my heart in a condition known as myocarditis. It began as a sore throat and a constant need to clear my throat, but has now progressed to a hacking, productive cough. I have also had some chest pain today, although admittedly it feels muscular.

Roughly 4 days into my symptoms (6 days ago now) I went to ER and they performed ECG and took blood. Cardiac troponins were not elevated and ECG was normal. However, I can't get my mind off the idea that because my viral symptoms have worsened, the virus is attacking my heart and I now have myocarditis.

Is it worth going to ER again for an ECG and cardiac troponins to put my mind at ease? I've been reading reports over at the myocarditis foundation website and what strikes me as particularly terrifying about this disease is its tendency to randomly cause sudden death without prior warning.

"Bipolar disorder and pregnancy? I'm currently 14 weeks pregnant. This was not planned. I was not comfortable with terminating the pregnancy, so here we are. I was previously on 50mg seroquel, and 100mg lamictal, and since finding out I was pregnant, I had to drop the seroquel, but stayed on lamictal and actually bumped up to 200mg because I was not fairing well without the seroquel. I'm in therapy once a week and I see my psychiatric nurse once a month. My OB is okay with me taking lamictal I'd it is helping me, which was a relief as I was scared I was going to fave judgement and have to advocate hard for myself. 

Anyways, where I am at now is that I'm struggling to sleep more than 4 or 5 hours at a time. I'm craving coffee again, I want a pack of cigarettes, my driving habits are slipping into unsafe behaviors, and I'm picking fights and arguments...all which are my known mania symptoms. I'm sure there are more I'm just unaware of, and I've suspected an episode was coming on as soon as my sleep became troublesome, though I wanted to brush that off as 2nd trimester energy boosts, but it's clearly more than that. 

My therapist gave me a whole packet of stuff to help me calm my senses, and not agitate myself more, which I guess will be helpful, but I'm so, so, so scared. I'm not going to give in to the symptoms if I can help it, I'm definitely not going to pick up smoking again and will actively remove myself from the temptation, but I'm just so worried because this could go so many different ways and I feel more like a fish out of water than I've ever felt in my life. 

I guess I just needed to vent a little, but also, are there any moms here who have experienced pregnancy with their bipolar disorder? What did you experience while pregnant? What about post partum? Is there any advice/tips/suggestions you could give me?

This life is so short and we have to make the absolute best of it we can while we are able to. But I let everything fall by the wayside. I let my avoidance control me and continue to fail to accomplish anything or hold fulfilling relationships. Even if I miraculously get it under control I'll still have all of these years I spent in isolation doing nothing of value. I fear that on my deathbed I'll be alone looking back on my life in regret.

I hadn't heard about the drug until today, I've only ever been on citalopram 20mg for depression, it didnt help and made me suicidal.

I dont have problems sleeping. Actually, I told him I sleep too much, if anything. It seems that a lot of people that are prescribed seroquel do. I'm reading all of these horror stories about being crazy high and hallucinations that I've kind of scared myself from taking it.

"I suffer from a relationship, I REALLY NEED HELP  (Content Warning)   


Hello people,

I am writing to you because I need help.

Please excuse me first of all because English is not my first language.

I am desperate, I am destroyed.

I am bipolar and borderline.

I am in a relationship with someone who was perfect for me at first and has since neglected me, disrespected me, ignored me, and blamed me for everything because of my disorder.

Before I met him, I had managed to rebuild myself, to go back to work after a 2.5 year break (I was diagnosed in 2019).

Since then, I have been living in hell.

He lived far away from me (950km/690miles) and we tried life together but that's when my disorder revealed itself.

He was constantly on the computer, talking down to me, having horrible outbursts and insulting me.

He even threatened to kill himself and jump off my balcony and I tried to hold him back and that's when I had my first ""boderline"" crisis where I started screaming in pain and wanting to end my life.

I called him parents to warn them of his actions and when they called, my boyfriend said everything was fine while I was crying in the back and they could hear me.

A lot of things happened and I asked him to go home (he lives with his parents).

Since then, it's been hot and cold between us.

One day I'm ""his Queen"", the next day he barely pays attention to me and when I criticize him for not even asking if I'm okay, he says ""because you think I'm your knight in shining armor?"" when for me it's the minimum for any social contact.

You should know that from the beginning of our relationship, I was threatened with a knife by one of his family members and insulted and while we were abroad in a remote place I didn't know.

His family consults a lot of medieums, psychics, card readers and all of them say that I am the devil and not made for their son while I have never shown anything but goodness, kindness and compassion despite what they made me go through (recently, I learned that they would be persuaded that I raped their son and that my first goal is to ""kill him"" while I have never raised my hand on someone).

They even told me while her sister wanted hut me with the knife that it was ok because ""the devil is INSIDE HER' and so it means that it's not her fault and they didn't event ask if I was fine once ?!

Last week was the worst of all, I hurt myself, I hit my head multiple times during his present and I tore my face off + hit myself with an alter because I heard his parents on the phone saying again that I was going to kill him and he did nothing to stop it and instead he left when I could have killed myself.

I am stuck in this relationship, I don't know how to get out of it.

I feel like I can't see any way out because I feel like no one will want me because I'm ""crazy"" and I don't want to live with someone like him, nor do I want to start a family with him because of the principles he may have and his family (I can't tell you everything, but the story of the knife already tells you a lot)

I need help, my caregivers don't tell me anything, they listen to me and that's it.

No one understands me.

The more I talked to him about my illness and how to help me if I was neglected, the more he did nothing.

When we lived together and he insulted me, I took it upon myself at first and went to him with a big smile and hugged him as he pushed me hard and said ""YOU DISGUST ME!"" to then tell me ""sorry, I love you more than anything, you can't even imagine, I will never leave you alone again, I will do the work for both of us as you have done for the past 7 months, everything it's over I'm not going to abandon you anymore, it's up to me to make sure that you become again the one you were before my family and I broke you"" then suddenly it's ""you're responsible for everything, it's is because you are hypersensitive""

His family hates me because I'm ""too pretty, too nice, too cuddly to be true"" when I'm just me!

I can't take it anymore, yesterday and this morning I wanted to end it, I can't tell myself that I'm going to get out of this, I can't tell myself that I'm going to manage to escape of him because I'm hooked in spite of myself and I don't know why because we no longer live together and it's a daily suffering.

He's h24 on his computer, he just plays, he has nothing to talk about, we don't share anything anymore (he was different at first, it was amazing then he showed his face when he moved in with me).

I just asked him again if we could call because I need help because I'm in pain, I'm taking xanax for the first time in my life in addition to my usual treatments when I've always managed to do without (and even with that, it doesn't work)

I'm begging you, help me, advise me, I don't know, but I need help from people who understand me.  
Thank you very much",Bipolar

Last year (2022), in February, I quit college (online) cuz I can't handle it, even though I got a good grade in one of my courses but I didn't think I got it at all! And after that, I wanted to start the business but I don't have money, my mom gave me money but she just gave me 16$, she said: ""After the items sold out, I will give u money again"". But when I started to sell in my shop, it didn't succeed cuz maybe I just have little items. Also, when I was in college, my mom rarely gave me money, unless it was for college tuition and the money for internet. My father is still alive but he never paid for my school. But the hurt thing in my life was my stepbrothers think that my father never gave them money cuz they think that all of my father's money was used up for me. 

And now I am 22y.o. I sent many job applications (about 20+ or more), but just get accepted for 1 job, but I ignore it cuz I can't ride a motorcycle and I think the salary was too low. I was thinking that I want to go to another country for a job, so I can get better life cuz I have a chronic illness and mental illness, but I don't have money.

"Tardive Dyskinesia, medication adjustments and the manic aftermath. Hi everyone, 

It’s hard to know where to start. I started medication for bipolar as an adolescent (13 I think) but I have been bipolar since I was a young child, and it feels like there is nothing before it. I am entering my late twenties now (so still young) but as you may know even in my childhood there was a lot of controversy about whether children could be bipolar and very little known about medicating children for being bipolar. I did have a child psychiatrist and I sincerely believe he did the best he could for me. That being said, everything was sort of a stab in the dark. I am sure there are many of you who can relate. 

It turns out that a good psychiatrist is hard to find around here, so the next one I went to missed a medication interaction between a non psychiatric medication I was already on and lamictal. He also happened to miss my signs of tardive dyskinesia even though I brought them to his attention several times. I no longer see him. I am no longer on lamictal. 

I now see a new psychiatrist and she is fantastic. I am in good hands and trust that, but she had to bring me down from a fairly standard dose of Abilify I have been on for the past 14 years to basically almost nothing because of the tardive dyskinesia. I was fine at first, surprisingly fine and stable, but now I have been manic/hypomanic for a couple of weeks when I was pretty well managed before. 

I see my psychiatrist in three days. I plan to talk to her and come up with a plan to deal with this at that appointment. 

It’s just at my last appointment, before the mania started, we talked about my choices and my medication options are now limited based on what did not work for me before and especially now thanks to developing TD and I am just scared. There may be some major changes to my medication. 

I have started this amazing life with this amazing girl. I have a stable job. We are getting married next year. We have a home. We have cats. We have a future. We want kids. I am scared because although she has seen me in bad moments and knows of my past, she has not truly experienced me at my worst. I know she will always love me but I am terrified- terrified of the td getting worse. Terrified of feeling out of control again. 

I don’t really know what I expect from any comments. I suppose I just needed to say this to people who would understand how I feel. Most people I know and talk to don’t get it at all. They have not lived it. I needed to confide in people who struggle with what I struggle with. 

It’s like my life that I worked so hard to build and maintain since I was a child (with consistent therapy, with medication, and with A LOT of everyday effort) is going to be ripped out from under me and it’s not even my doing. I did everything right. It hurts. It’s scary. It’s a lot. 

Sorry this is so long. I hope there are still people willing to read it.

"Social anxiety-geared remedies and treatments have made things worse **Trigger warning for suicidal ideation mention.
Also, long post alert. This is something that’s been brewing for a while that I hadn’t been able to articulate until now.

I’m 24 years old. I’ve been actively trying to combat social anxiety since I was 17. And after reflecting on these past years, I truly feel like all of the things I did to try to improve have only made my feelings worse and solidified my fears. 

For example, public speaking: I was told throughout school and therapy that practicing public speaking would make it easier over time. I was also told I would need to do a lot of it to have a successful career. 

So, I did the following: joined the media club in high school, where I made intercom announcements and once made a TV announcement. Taught Spanish to children as an assignment. Took opportunities to read aloud in class and chose speaking assignments when given the choice. In college: I had several mandatory presentations. I joined clubs, and did almost weekly public speaking for various purposes for them. I called numbers for a bingo game for over 100 people and also proctored a club election. I then became a resident advisor which involved pretty regular public speaking. 

Let me tell you, it did NOT get easier y’all lmao. I swear to god, I kept telling myself it would get better and waiting for it to get easier and it only got harder emotionally. I definitely improved my skills, but every public speaking incident wreaked absolute havoc on my psyche. Like throwing up beforehand, staying up and ruminating after, shaking, emotional anguish, insomnia, the works. Like I’d argue it got even worse as time went on. No amount of praise was ever able to shake it, and i’ve received some pretty consistent positive feedback. I have this thought of like, probability. Like I WILL fuck up and embarrass myself during an event. And every time a speech goes well, I feel like my odds of failure increase. Plus I’m not sure how much I trust the positive feedback I’ve gotten. I can accept that I’m an effective speaker, but anything more than that feels fake like people are lying to make me feel better. 

So, public speaking hasnt gotten easier. I’m out of options. And it’s frustrating that no one around me understands this because, to them, I’m a sufficient speaker. But the idea of speaking to a group of people makes me want to fucking kill myself. Like every time. And now… I have a ton of lovely memories that play in my head when I think of speaking. Like my brain has the motherload of material to make me feel deep levels of shame, embarrassment, regret, anxiety, etc. 

I wish i’d never started doing this stuff because now people actually expect it of me and I am haunted by awful memories that make me feel worse than I did before. I mean for fuck’s sake, I’ll get in a panic because I remembered speaking to KIDS. Six year olds. Who the fuck is embarrassed to speak to six year olds? Remembering things like this can straight-up ruin an otherwise perfect day and completely sour my mood. 

It’s not just public speaking. Its making friends, joining clubs, volunteering, working, the works. I faced my fears and they fought back viciously. And after covid isolation, I find it literally impossible to force myself to try these things again, even though I know I’m capable of them. I just don’t want to contribute to the material my brain uses against me. I feel full, like I’m out of storage space. I’m just sick of the regret and embarrassment and guilt over existing the way I did. 

I feel like I’m destined to spend my future disappointing people and failing. I’ll never be like I once was, and even if I do then it will just be exhausting and miserable. Right before covid I was reaching a breaking point anyway—like I was about to quit my job (or get fired) and possibly school because I couldn’t handle the hole I’d dug myself into. I feel spent and directionless. I dont know what my goals are anymore. I don’t even know who I am because I spent so long trying to be someone I’m not.",Personality disorder

"Imagine waking every single day, after having not slept much/properly and the first thing that hits you is a massive wave of dread and anxiety. Imagine going to bed and not being able to fall asleep because your heart is beating so fast, due to massive anxiety. Imagine being in that alert state 24/7 and only being able to ""rest"" from actually passing out from exhaustion. And ""anxiety"" is not even a proper word that describes the overwhelming wave that crashes down. I have always had depression as far as I remember. I have always thought that life was a paradox not worth living. I am 25. I am a soon to be researcher. I still think that I am stupid for not having ended it sooner. There has not been a moment I have not thought about it, but for the past couple of years I almost convinced myself that maybe there was something out there that was worth living for. Studies, career, relationships...building a life with a household, with plans, with a future. Things worth researching, using my brain and skills to further advance humanity. But guess what? All those are sources of pain. Insane, immense, indescribable pain. I have made many mistakes, out of pain. I have tried becoming the best version of myself, the best that I could be. I am still desperately trying. But its all just pain and failure. There seem to be nothing I can do to change my fate. All I can see is dark and more dark. At this point in time, I do not see any hope in my life. Career-wise, there is no fulfillment that I can get from it. On the side of my hobbies, there is nothing that I can be proud of achieving or mastering. There is always the voice of dissatisfaction or perfectionism. Relationship-wise, I am a mess. I have hurt and gotten hurt. I have done so many mistakes, and despite remediating and improving myself, it does not seem like there is any future for me in that either. I feel weak. I feel ugly. I feel uninteresting. I feel incompetent. I feel mediocre. I feel unwanted. I feel unloved. I feel undesired. I feel unliked. I cannot stand my body nor my mind. I cannot stand my personality. I cannot stand myself.Being inside my head and living with myself is daily hell. All of these feelings, yet the cherry on top is just massive debilitating anxiety. Something that not even medication, drugs, alcohol can solve. Brain chemistry and molecular dynamics aside, those do not remove the sources of my anxiety. The sources that pretty much are permanent.So I am pretty convinced that this will soon be the end for me. Because the massive pain and anxiety are taking over my mind and body. Because no amount of doctors and professional help can remove the sources and causes. Because the best alternative solution would be to stay at a psych ward. What is the point then? Keeping myself alive at a place to keep myself alive, just for the sake of keeping myself alive? The absurdity of it all. The only reasonable decision is clearly obvious.

"Stressed In and Out of Work For the last month I've been feeling fed up with my job and some of the people on my team. Every morning during meetings I fake being nice and wanting to talk with them, and the more they talk the angrier I've been getting lately. 

I've had mishaps happen and to me it seems like there is a lot of favoritism that happens in my work place. To keep that bit short, people that have left have said the same thing about the favoritism.

My anger with my job is also spilling into my personal life because I'm having dreams about these people now! I don't want to see a handful of them while I'm working and now they are in my dreams!

My personal life has been a hectic mess too, as I've made some huge life changes - for the better - but with the work B.S and the remodeling I'm doing (it's my parents' home that I'm staying in and working on) I have no fuse and blow up on just about everything.

I had an idea of the work that needed done and in the order, and my dad does the exact opposite of what I ask and tell him to do. Now all of a sudden I need to spend both more time and money on a project I asked him to start a month ago. 

The reason the remodel is pissing me off is cause it's not just me staying in the home now, my partner is too and even with the upstairs space done, it's not enough space. I've thrown things away and so has he in an attempt to make room and my dad seems to think there is all the time in the world to complete the work.

Has anyone had issues like this, where at work they feel wrongly treated and brood about it and the same goes for their personal life?

Everything is driving me bonkers cause I can't leave my job cause I desperately need the cash and I'm worried that if I went to another job it would be even worse!

"Can denying my sexuality be a cause of AVPD? So few years back i got AVPD diagnosis. I am now trying to get out of this rut and fix things. Thing is: i have avoided everything all my life, even my feelings. So its hard.

One thing i am thinking of past few days is that when i knew i was gay at 13 years old, i avoided thinking about it and refusing to accept my sexuality. I only came out once i was 19. So 6 years i was 'locked' in avoiding being who i am. I am in my 30s now and after a bad breakup been trying to figure my life out.

Is it possible that being ' in the closet' for more then 6 years contribute in developing AVPD? As i notice i still dont accept my sexuality 100% and still think what people might think of it and reject me because of my sexuality.

"Rant but not really,newly diagnosed but then again I’m not Hello all , I’m new here but I feel like I shouldn’t be lol 
Yesterday was kind of a mental health day as I was talking to a social worker who was helping me find a new therapist. Long story short we got into my previous diagnosis’ and I told her mild depression , adhd and anxiety. Yes these are true but however the one that is relevant to this post that popped up that I didn’t know was bipolar. I end up contacting my previous psychiatrist because I did not recall him saying this ( I swear he didn’t ) and he said yes but it is unspecified. He diagnosed me because of my constant irritability and made a point to say today I may be in remission because I wasn’t as snappy as before. I honestly Just thought the things he would say would rub me the wrong way. Next week he’ll do a full evaluation. 

A few years back another therapist diagnosed me with bipolar disorder I forgot which , but I remember her say something of me being manic. I honestly don’t think she’s working anymore but I wanted this evaluation at the time because I believed I was bipolar starting around 13-16 years old. I had my reasons for it. Fast forward to last year my last psychologist said I was misdiagnosed and it was just adhd/add. I had mentioned my sex drive/hyper sexuality (which I may speak on in another post), my impulsive urges to do things, mood swings that can be intense, etc etc she said it was just a mixture of my depression and adhd. 
So now here I am, and thinking back to the things I’ve done before and do now. These things I am trying to control and make sense of mainly the hyper sexuality I started to wonder if I was just a sex addict because of my habits and started looking into help to stop these things but yet my only problem is when I’m in the mood lol.

"Symptoms for bipolar disorder? Hello all,
I'm 18 years old and I'm new to Reddit. When I was ten years old, I began to have depression. It wasn't severe, but I would often isolate myself from others and think about dying. Over time, my depression has gotten worse. However, at age 12 I began to have severe mood swings. Sometimes I would get very angry at everybody and everything around me for no reason. Sometimes it would last for a few days, and then I would go back to feeling ""stable"" or depressed. At age 15, I began to have three distinct and intense emotions that have taken over my life until this point. I rarely felt stable at that point. This feeling can occur for a week or less, I feel veryyyyyyy euphoric. I actually love life and everything around me. I feel very energetic and hyper like a five year old. I'm bouncing off the walls, and talk very fast because my thoughts race. Sometimes I can't sleep at night because my thoughts would never shut up. However, I have never done anything impulsive. I'm mostly abnormally energetic and euphoric. Then, I can switch to a depressive episode. These are always the longest, they can last for 4-6 months. At that moment, I'm extremely suicidal. I've never tried to commit suicide because I'm scared of failing but the craving is always there. I'm also hopeless, think that everybody hates me, and I feel so dead and emotionally tired. I sleep for 8-9 hours and I still feel tired. I can have a good day and still feel extremely miserable even though I know I shouldn't. Then, after my depressive episode, I can feel super angry and annoyed at everything and everybody for no reason. I just get super angry and lash out at anybody, and I don't know why. This lasts for a week or less. I have been to 4 therapists and none of them have really helped; I can't really afford one right now. My family aren't very supportive, it's taboo to talk about mental illness so they ignore my symptoms or brush them off as hormones since I'm a female. Could I be bipolar? Is it just hormones? your insight would be nice, I hope to a doctor soon to get a proper diagnosis but your insight will be helpful.

"Do you think this a good description of our experiences? This is an excerpt from the introduction of a book called *On The Outside Looking In* by Daniela Grazia, about her experiences with social anxiety. 

I’ve used it to describe my experiences to others, but I have both social anxiety and AvPD so I worry if I’m not explaining from the ‘correct’ side (?). I’m also a psychology student and find it interesting to try to distinguish the two. I suppose it only matters in my head, but it does matter.

The quote (one long one, formatting issues):
&gt;“It is a feeling that comes over me often, an old menace that stubbornly refuses to die. In classes, in coffee shops, in almost any activity where surrounded by potential friends. It is the profound feeling of alienness.

&gt;”At any moment in the group conversation, something in me snaps. I look around the table at the other people blissfully talking, and I do not feel like one of them. I am not one of them. I am different, a foreigner, an alien, a stranger in a strange land.

&gt;”And then the urge to run away, to hide, to be away from the people comes up. Sometimes I fight the urge and stay on, hiding my vast discomfort. Other times I do run away, cursing the cowardice and the shame, miserable in my misanthropy, but secure in my solitude.

&gt;”There is something in the faces, in the voices of the others that I do not have. They are into the conversation. They live outside themselves, I live inside myself. They talk, listen, and laugh; I think, listen, and smile.

"Worried about my gap year I am a college senior and lately I have been stressed to the point that it has been affecting my sleep schedule. Currently I am taking a gap year to retake some prerequisites and study for the MCAT med school, I don’t live at home due to my school being far away, but I am stress that I have to be at home and study for it. I didn’t have my own room before I left to college. I had to lose one of the unused rooms in my house as my personal room, unfortunately, my parents decided that they prefer this room compared to the master bedroom. It was fine at the moment because I was away at college and I had a house near my school. Now that I’m about to graduate and hopefully move back home to save money I have brought up this issue if I could get the room back but instead of hearing me out, they had stated that I can just go to the library study. I am not sure whether or not I should just suck it up and move back home or save up enough money to move out officially. Any advice would be wonderful!",Stress

I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 but they seem to think it’s something else as I don’t fit the category properly. My GP put me on antidepressants. I’m cycling between moods in a matter of days and I don’t know what to do. When I go to my GP I’m not being heard and I feel like no one takes me seriously. I last visited my GP exactly a month ago when she started me on these antidepressants, I asked if I can be referred again for an assessment. I was referred to SPA and then they contacted me and over the telephone asked me what’s going on (I told them everything) but at the time I was good (manic) so she was like ok that’s good let’s leave you on the medication for now. I don’t know if that’s what my GP referred me to or if I should be waiting on another referral? I’m just so confused and sick and tired of all these moods. I can’t be productive or do anything when I’m like this. I’m just feeling so down and depressed, I have no idea where my time even goes. I’ll be going back to my GP next week but what should I say?

"Death of Seasons [self-hatred] (/spoiler) I was listening to one of my favorite songs from grade school, and I realized that it fits perfectly in describing how I feel towards depression, my will to survive depression, and the angst, remorse, and grief of falling into a depression. Here is the song:  
.  
.  
.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
""Of late, it's harder just to go outside  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
  To leave this deadspace with hatred, so alive  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
  Writhing with sickness, thrown into banality, I decay  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
  Killed by the weakness, but forced to return, turn it off    
  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
I watch the stars as they fall from the sky  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
I held a fallen star and it wept for me, dying  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
I feel the fallen stars encircle me, now as they cry  
  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Out there so quickly grows malignant tribes  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Posthuman extinction excels unrecognized  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Feeling surrounded, so bored with mortality, I decay  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 
All of this hatred is fucking real, turn it on... yeah  

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
It won't be all right despite what they say  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
Just watch the stars tonight as they, as they disappear, disintegrate  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
And I disintegrate 'cause this hate is fucking real  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
And I hope to shade the world as stars go out and I disintegrate""  


The first stanza starts the process of slipping into depression. It’s hard to leave the walls that are now built around you, the hatred drawn inwards is real and deadly. Leaving is an escape, but the mind of depression “forces” you to return inwards, retreat back home, and continue the stages of decay, even violence:  “Killed by the weakness…turn it off""

The second stanza is how I see this process of suffering being reflected in the natural world through the observation of stars. I am reminded of the title of the song “Death of Seasons” which is organic and relates to nature. There is compassion inherent in seeing the suffering of them: “I held a fallen star and it wept for me” / “The fallen stars encircle me” is an act of compassion by nature itself, reminding me that the feelings of depression and disconnection are universal.

The third stanza is also about the outside world, but a reflection on society and other people, which is viewed as working a brutal and threatening agenda (malignant tribes). For me, viewing the world at large in this way begins to give birth to thoughts that lead me to believe that the world is cruel, and that I no longer wish to participate in it, which completes the process of depression and fatefully, gives rise to the momentum of wanting to take my own life.

The bridge, or last stanza, is a confirmation of the reality of depression, merely the way things are, so to speak. The vocalist directs the attention to the sky, and sees the completion of the cycle, the end of the season when things wither and die. Yet compassion for the whole world is alive, “I hope to shade the world as stars go out” which still amazes me, that in the throes and thick of a hard depression the parts of me that want to help and be a part of the world live on.",Bipolar
"Can’t seem to shake this funk… Hey everyone. I seem to have fallen into a real blue funk lately and I can’t seem to shake it. I’ve been on antidepressants for years and deal with some pretty intense anxiety, but I’m usually able to pull myself out as I’ve dealt with it for so long. I’ve cleaned my house, taken a nap, done my laundry, got outside, anything that usually helps alleviate - I’ve done it. I’m in a happy marriage, financially stable, overall live a healthy lifestyle but I seem to have this constant ache in my chest and lump in my throat lately. I don’t know how to get past it and it seems like nothing is working, but I really don’t want to see my doctor unless this persists for another week or two… does anyone have any suggestions for something that has helped them beat a blue phase?

"Shocked, Embarrassed &amp; Ashamed Hello everyone, my first time ever using Reddit. I was first diagnosed with severe depression at the age of thirteen. In 2017, I was told that they have misdiagnosed me and I am bipolar with insomnia and anxiety. I was told that my medication is very important to keep me regulated and without it could be dangerous for my life. I refuse to take the medication because of the feeling zoned out like a zombie, incapacitated and no ambition. The breakup I experienced in 2017 seemed to have an impact on my mental health causing me to have rages of anger and outbursts verbally and physically (breaking things, throwing and punching anything). Recently, I have been going through overwhelming troubling events that caused me to lose everything, facing homelessness, out of my control, no family support, no job, no money, pushed away friends, and no where to go. The person that I've been dating could relate to having bipolar and understand, but I managed to destroy it. Rages are heightened and outburst increasing. I've done something that brought me so much shame, embarrassment and shock. Two days ago on Instagram, I uploaded seven videos of me and in those videos I was having a manic tantrum attack. At that moment and in the mindset I was in didn't realize that I just showed my mental illness for the world to see, I just snapped. My inbox and notifications were sounding off rapidly like a person ring the doorbell. I snapped out of that trans and watched the videos and I  immediately removed them. I turned my phone off for the day. Throughout the day my mania were in and out and I haven't slept since that day.  Well this is who I am and wanted to share. Thanks!",Bipolar

"The worst part is the lack of hope I’m always gonna be like this. Even with years of therapy and meds, even while on copious amounts of confidence enhancing  and anxiety reducing drugs, I’m still too socially anxious and awkward. Sure I can force myself to socialise but I can’t force myself to enjoy it, or force myself to relax and just be myself. The fact that this shit isn’t getting any better no matter what I try is so demoralising, it makes everything else pointless, having severe avpd/social anxiety really does infect every little area of your life. I can’t hold a job, I can’t make friends, I haven’t talked to a girl in years, never mind having a relationship. My anxiety is so bad I get second hand anxiety watching people interact on a tv screen, or hearing others use voice chat in video games.

I’d be constantly stressed out, tense, unable to relax. I’d have nothing in common with them, I only ever feel comfortable alone.

"Head noise, intrusive thoughts, obsessive thinking Anybody else feel like their brain is bombarding them constantly? It’s 3 major things for me:

1. Music in my head. All the time, non-stop. Sometimes it’s a real song, sometimes it’s a song I made up in my head. Sometimes it’s a song I like, sometimes it’s super annoying (even my own songs). 

2. Intrusive thoughts. Could be anything from violent and disturbing images to something super benign. I have a bag of Mamma Chia brand chia seeds, every time I see I think “mamma chia, mamma chia figaro.”

3. Obsessive thinking. I’ll become interested in a subject to the point where I can’t stop thinking about it. I’ll try to focus on something else, but I creeps back in and I wind up reading the same Wikipedia article 100 times instead of doing what I’m supposed to be doing.

Making matters worse is that this guy basically checks all the boxes on shit that makes me insecure - tall, douchey rich guy (in contrast to me - 5'8"", not at all douchey guy with a good but not incredibly glamorous career). Anyway, these pieces of information - that she pretty much opened up to me sexually only when she felt threatened by another woman, and that she has clearly been with other guys who she's had much more sexual interest in than me - pretty much led me to the alternate hypothesis that it wasn't the vaginal pain and the birth control so much as her lack of attraction to me in comparison to past boyfriends.",Stress

"One dumb thing causing the big M today Hi y’all! I cannot use the TW flair I dunno why.
I am overall stable. But something happened today and I FEEL manic. Grandiose thoughts, hyper active brain (usually my brain is quiet and organised, now it works so much I have a headache lol) etc, you name it. Dreams of doing this and that, eh. And I couldn’t even take a nap.
All because... I wrote to my aunt I was never close with. Yes you read it right. You might ask yourself- „ee, what?” I hasten to explain.
So there was the year 2019, I went full-blown manic. It was really intense. My closest family was away but they knew something was up because of the things I had been telling them, my online activity and overall behaviour reported by more distant family that lives nearby. (I visited them xx times per day.)
So one time I really was scared I will die or something, I opened the door to run to the family nearby and when I opened the door there was this aunt (she is not the one I visited, she lives also nearby, but more far away then the other family members)
I was afraid to sleep (I didnt sleep properly in this time period, only kind of blacked out) 
She tuckled me to sleep and I had some rest. 
When my closest family came back, clearly distressed (the way the house looked + many other things) they called the ambulance and there I was in the mental hospital lol. 
This aunt was helping my mother to deal with me.
Ok now back to these times, this aunt is a kind of person that forwards these pictures with written things on them to everybody. As I don’t own the whatsapp app, I wasnt reading them. I only installed it sometimes and I wrote like a flower to her as a response or wishing also everything well (as a response to these pictures)
Today I opened whatsapp and the last pictures from her were at the beginning of march. It was unusal because she used to send them a lot. I kind of regretted not replying more to her even with a flower emoji and I randomly send her „happy (second) day of spring 🌷”
And like that, it kind of switched something in my brain lol. 
I want to mention that my mania was always occuring in spring/summer time. 
It is a little bit chaotic but english isnt my first language. I wish I didnt send this message.
There is also a possibility that I somehow didnt get these pictures and she was still sending them.

"Swelling under ""Xiphoid process"", results in mental issues and gastrointestinal tract issues Hello,

I am 27 years old male. I am a lonely guy that drinks a lot of beer. I drink only beer intentionally, so that the harm of alcohol is less. 


Recently, however this is still becoming an issue. I let my alcohol addiction to beer to overrule my healthy life. I smoke a lot of cigarrettes and I drink beer every day. I also drink so much coffee. My life is good, but recently I feel this anxiety. My overall performance is getting lower too.


A few months ago I noticed that I have swelling exactly bellow my ""Xiphoid process"". It is something internal. I have Gastrointestinal tract issues. I feel stomache discomfort, as well as drifting issues regularly. I researched about symptoms and could not get any information about it...

Recently I feel a lot of anxiety and it is messing my decisions and mental health already. I think this could turn into dementia or something serious. It could be a cancer, as well, I don't know.


I could have possibly gone to a doctor, but the problem is that I come from a poor family and owe around 500 euro for health care, which I cannot spend at this point. 

I hope you guys could help me identify the possible reasons for all this, so I can make some adequate response to it.. And I will see a doctor soon probably. I am just a bit scared and unaware of what I did to myself. 


Hope you guys support me and give me advice, Thanks!

**EDIT;** Also, I have been very anxcious around people ever since child. Every time I talk to someone, I feel something like pain in my stomache and have to make effort for all my conversation. I ended up a quiet and lonely guy because of it. This is the whole reason I abuse alcohol, cigarrettes and coffee. I wanted to overcome something psychological to be more connected. This abuse was obviously affecting my digestive system or something.. i don't know. I know that this will become a nightmare and could possibly be the reason for my death some day.

**Edit:** sorry, I am actually 30 years old male. I am so embarrased right now. 

**TLDR:** Swelling under ""Xiphoid process"", anxiety, mental disorder due to beer abuse and smoking

"Hi everyone! I am a lifelong sufferer or generalized anxiety and historically have only has situational depression and as a result I have lots of tools for anxiety but few for depression. The past 2 years I have been suffering from severe depression. Right when i started to feel hopeful I found out I was to be evicted for owner move in. In 1 week I have to leave my home and city that I have called home for the last 20 years. No one is helping me pack or clean and tbh I would probably refuse any that a offered because I would not want anyone to see what has turned into a hoard as a result of my depression. I have been living in squalor. I have a plans and the technical tools i need to execute the cleanup and move but all I have been doing for three days is crying. This eviction is super personal and has forced me to face things about loved ones and myself that i was not prepared to do. The amount of grief, anger, and fear I am feeling is overwhelming and totally paralyzing me. If I cannot get my place cleaned up its going to make my current issues 10 times bigger. I need an off switch, or at least a pause button so I can get what i need done. Are there any tools /strategies that can help me let go of Or at least temporarily stuff these feelings so that I can get what I need to get done?I should note that I am being diligent about basic self-care such as eating, hydrating, and sleeping so you can skip those bits.Any and all tips are very much appreciated, I am drowning over here, thanks.

"I just found this community and I am just curious as to how does depression feel. Sometimes my feelings are really really strong and i feel like i cannot control them, my mind gets filled with negative stuff but I have always tried to see the positive side of everything. I rly do not think I have any reason to be sad or depressed, I really am happy with my life and the people I love surrounding me.But sometimes out of nowhere, without reason or for really insignificant stuff I suddenly feel lonely, like no one cares about me, deep down I know that is not true, but idk why it keeps getting to me every now and then. I am an overthinker, and I have tried to change that for me and the people i love bc it has brought me problems all my life, this past year i have calmed my anxiety and the way I worry about stuff, I am feeling a lot better. But something I have never told anyone in my life is how these negative thoughts come to me sometimes, as if I am not worthy or just do not deserve to be here. it is weird, I just feel like no one would understand, idk if it is actually depression or just random normal sad thoughts. But I do not want to tell anyone I care about bc I think it would worry them and that I would destroy what i have with the people I love, that they would think I am crazy or something and leave me, that they will get tired of me. i just try to ignore my bad feelings and see the positive side, realizing that my reasons to be sad are not valid, but it is hard and i do not think i have depression but sometimes it comes to my mind that maybe i have and do not want to admit it? Idk I just do not want ppl to change their view of me or how they treat me or make them feel guilty for what I feel randomly, but idk if that is just making me close off, make a barrier with everyone instead of facing what my heart feels... So ye I just feel stupid because i do actually have everything to be happy and I truly am, i am not insecure of myself either, I am happy with everyone that is with me right now, well my friends let me down a lot but apart from that it is all good, my family, my bf and the few friends I trust.

"Self-diagnosis for this, what do you think? Obviously I think therapy is extremely important this, but I also think it's one of those things that can be self-diagnosed. With the age of the internet, it's easy to get into the mode of self-diagnosis, whether it be for physical or mental illness. But, I feel emotionally struck by this, it's not a fun thing or something that feels relatable, it strikes me to the core and I don't want it to. I don't want this to be the reality, but it resonates so much more than social anxiety disorder ever did. I'm not saying that a feeling is an indicator of the truth, but I've read a lot about it and continuously have tried to think of ways in which I may not, but it fits so well. Beyond on the symptoms, I've dung into the roots, the commo thought patterns, behaviors, etc. It's not something I feel will pull me down or become a self-fulfilling prophecy, because as painful as it's been to learn about, it's something I feel refreshed by, in having language to explain my experiences and perception of myself. I thought I was self aware before, but I had a lot of false beliefs and I also have a tendency to detach from my unhealthy and hurtful behaviors.",Personality disorder
"Health anxiety in PEAKS So.. I’m 21 now and I have crazy health anxiety from the past two years. When I was 13 my mother was diagnosed with Leukemia..she’s fine now but I never came out of that trauma. I’m really happy to have her by my side and I feel like I am the luckiest today.. but it has left a very bad effect on me. Everyday I feel like I have a disease developing inside of me..

I’m really really scared of cancer and any life threatening disease.. every week I have a new symptoms to worry about. I have constant heart palpitations. I’ve tried a lot.. exercised, distracted myself but that fear never left me. 
And now I am at my worst. I feel lightheaded in the middle of nowhere, I have palpitations, disorientation, depression and I keep crying. I have loss of appetite, gastric trouble, chest pains and what not! And recently I just checked my blood pressure it came out to be 140/80 with a racing heart. This has been killing me since the past week. I’m so scared now that I have hypertension and it’s going to affect my health. ( because when I googled hypertension it showed lightheadedness as a symptom)
I also have another fear.. I can’t get any tests done. I’m really scared of getting them done bc I feel like they’ll be something wrong and life can never get better.

We were cuddling so I see it as a indicator, but I feel that it’s difficult. I’m scared of “coming too strong there” but not setting frames around it makes me also feel insecure.

Should I try to look at it like a plain opportunity for my Person with AvPD to the experience of cuddling ?
Because I know you folks may have trouble forming trust within possible romantic relationships, and that It may take a lot longer.

"Suspected lead contamination of sink and dishwasher. Should I be concerned?

"I (16F) live with my mother. My father left for ""work"" when I was very little. He never texted/called me (on my birthday once a year) or supported us financially. He comes home every 1-2 years for a ""visit"" and it is hell for me. My parents are not married, they do not really get along but they are not split up either. I wanted to have a dad like all my friends but now the deed is done and I want to cut him off. He feels like a stranger to me and I would not say that I ""hate"" him necessarily but sometimes I do. Whenever I try to explain this to my mom she says that he is my dad and that he loves me in ""his way"". Then I start crying and she starts screaming at me to stop because this is not a good reason. My mom makes me feel like it is my fault and that I am doing it for ""attention"" or ""on purpose"". I try to at least tolerate him but I cannot. I just remember the times when he once beat me really bad when we were on holiday (the only time but it stuck with me) or when he had s*x with my mother next to me and made me smell his hand after fingering her(I am sorry, this is really embarrassing but I had to say it because it is the biggest reason I hate him so much). I remember this like it is happening right now and often I cry about this. I was little and maybe they think I ""forgot"" or did not know what is going on. I tell my mom that I cannot stand him but never about these reasons, but i know for a fact she will gaslight me. I also remember the times he played with me but the things he did (doing the deed next to me, letting me hear them on holiday) were just horrible and traumatic. One time they did it in the bed i was supposed to be sleeping in and the sheets were all sweaty and gross, and they let me sleep in it. I might be overreacting though. 2 years ago he stayed like 2 months and I am scared he will want to stay this long too this time. Also the last year I have struggled with an eating disorder and I lost like 100 lbs, and he remembers me like being chubby. I am almost fully recovered now and learning to accept myself and my weight gain and he will make some comments that I do not wish to hear, I do not want to relapse. This year I will go to my grandmother while he is at my house and I hope to not be forced to see him. Now that is the whole thing, I do not hate him because he left me but because of those sexual things. I am fully AWARE being abandoned does not count as abuse and I completely agree and I do not hate him for that, but for the other things he did. Whenever I said something that did not sit right with me he was like ""Come on you are grown up, you are not 2 years old so you can understand those things"" and making me feel like it is my fault.

But I am trying to make up for it, and I offered to do lunch Sunday (he's accepted).

I'm unsure if I told him about my disorder, and honestly, I think he'd not get AvPD anyways. I have had many experiences telling people about AvPD and they just sort of give a ""well-meaning, but not getting it"" nod.

I have been diagnosed with AvPD for well over a year now, and I've been in therapy for even longer, so I'm quite good at the whole mindfulness thing.

"How to not hurt peoples feelings I think I’m doing better at socializing than before but after a big socialization day I get so worn out from all the effort it takes that I need a recovery day where I literally don’t interact with anyone or else I start shutting down. 

However society does not work on my schedule and so obviously I can’t always have a recovery. When I’m socially overwhelmed I tend to give short answers and seem super aloof, disinterested, monotone etc. sometimes people take this personally even though it has nothing to do with them, I’m just worn out.

Usually with strangers it doesn’t matter that much because I’ll never meet them again, but with my friends or partner it can be hard. They obviously care about me and start asking, “are you mad at me? Am I annoying? Etc.” and that kind of stuff is really irritating because it requires some level of delicacy by saying “you as a person are not annoying, but I’m just really irritated right now for reasons other than you, and you are exacerbating it. But it is not your fault and there’s no reason you would’ve known this” Like I wish I could just say that but literally nothing comes out of my mouth. I can’t manage anything other than a tiny whimper of a “no…” because I at least want to preserve their feelings. 

My partner especially gets insecure and frequently asks me “are you mad at me, do you hate me, am I annoying” somewhat in jest but also to an extent it’s a reflection of real insecurities I know she has told me about. I can’t handle navigating those questions when I’m socially overstimulated but I don’t want to make her insecure worse either.

"When I was barely over the age of one, cps took me away from my birth mom. Needless to say, I was found in a terrible state. The very first family to take me in as a foster child, eventually they were able to adopt me when I was 3. Sadly though, I was forced to continue my relationship with my mother throughout the years I was a foster child, which was ultimately detrimental in how I ended up. Luckily it was a closed adoption, sadly though, the parents who had adopted me, had divorced a few years later. My mom got me and the other kids, while occasionally we would see our dad. Though, my mother would rarely let me see my father.It was obvious from the start, I was different from other kids. I look back on it, and I realize just how much of a struggle I had to deal with. I attended special classes for my speech impediment, I was always getting bad grades and I just did not understand ANYTHING. Instead of getting me help, my mother did not believe in medicine or doctors. I just recently found out that she knew I always had ADD, but never told me. She would ground me for not crying when someone I did not love, would die. I was always getting grounded and I was never allowed inside the house. No matter how hydrated I would get, she would not allow me inside, and she worked me like a slave. Only ever cleaning when I was inside.Eventually I ended up living with my dad and his new wife when I became a teen. I ended up getting caught having sex, and my father who was extremely strict, grounded me for years. I started getting treated like I was a dirty person, and that they would not feel comfortable allowing such a person around their kids. And to this day I am still treated like this. What more, I went back and forth between my mom and dad, eventually I was kicked out before I could graduate and have struggled ever since. I always struggled with depression, but as soon as I became an adult, I started truly feeling suicidal and depressed. I started coming out to my family, who I have Always had a rocky relationship with, and was always shut down and told to stick it up.They ignored my pain and suffering, and I refused to ever ask help from any of them. But my sister would always have my back, she would make sure I would not be homeless. And now I just find myself in a rut. I am in the first relationship I have had for years and its terrible.

I would become desperately depressed, with suicidal ideation, worthlessness, etc. With each crash worse than the last. This cycle probably occurred 20 times in a span of about a year. After telling him this, he said that it sounds a lot like bipolar. He's a therapist, not a doctor, so obviously, no diagnosis. My doctor put me on Latuda along with my Zoloft and Wellbutrin.

"Acceptance This is a difficult topic to discuss but I'm genuinely curious as to if/how others have done this and what impact it has had on their lives.

The kind of acceptance I'm talking about isn't just an intellectual acknowledgement of having issues. For a long time, for example, I could say to myself that I'm depressed, anxious, and struggling to succeed in life, at least by metrics of the culture that I reside in. That's relatively easy to do.

What I'm speaking of is a shift in perspective where you allow yourself to be disabled and accept living life very differently than what is expected. In doing so, you effectively turn off the mechanism that activates masking, which exposes vulnerabilities, and just say ""F it, I'll deal with the consequences"". 

This means that:

1) You accept that you'll be targeted by others, misunderstood, and often viewed as low status, because generally people aren't very understanding of problems that aren't obvious, like a physical disability. 
2) You accept that you're not likely to be appealing/attractive to potential or existing romantic interests. This is particularly salient to men, who are selected for traits that showcase an ability to provide.
3) You accept that you'll need emotional, financial and/or vocational assistance for the remainder of your adult years. As such, you must let go of a desire for a fully independent lifestyle.
4) You accept that, in all likelihood, what you have to say won't hold much value to others outside of a supportive setting. Maybe you didn't have much to say anyways.
5) You accept a humility of attitude and position. You are no longer competing with others in the rat race, at least not directly, and have no need to get ahead.. and..
6) You accept that you weren't motivated to do so to begin with. Moving mountains around just isn't your thing.

An image comes to mind of a disheveled man holding a sign on the street corner. I imagine there's no pride left to speak of in someone like that. Just acceptance that the world isn't meant for some kinds of people.

I know this sounds depressing but this is where I'm at in considering how to proceed with my life. It feels as though I'm flailing around, grabbing at the air helplessly, in some futile effort to grasp on to an ideal of something I'm not.. a normal, self-sufficient person. 

Just to be clear, I don't want to be homeless. I'd hope to do just enough to avoid that. But what this level of acceptance implies is a sense of freedom to be myself, as I am in the present moment, without fighting it.

The idea here is to do something radically different to change my outlook and ease the stress that I'm experiencing. I would guess others here can relate to that stress, which is the definition of AvPD.

So, has anyone taken this journey and would be willing to share some wisdom? Is this kind of acceptance a good idea?

Or does anyone want to share their thoughts, generally?

"I find it so frustrating as a highly anxious and depressed person to do career tests because they rely on your passion for specific activities and I find myself answering ""I dislike it very much"" to the various questions (e.g,. working in construction, healthcare, finance, whatever). I've been trying to get back to work again because it seems my severe depression and anxiety won't go away and there is only so much medication and therapy can help me. Of course, I haven't tried every kind of therapy but what had been offered to me at low cost. But I've tried many medications.

Anyhow, I feel very frustrated because after trying couple of online part time jobs (like writing marketing stuff on websites) and finding myself not motivated enough to work sufficient hours to make ends meet, I'm trying to start from zero again and do some career tests to find what motivates me. But those tests don't offer some magical information but just rely on what you're passionate about. Like they give you 50 questions and ask you how much you like doing different activities, like installing cabinets, diagnosing disease in people, giving financial advice to someone wanting to get a loan, helping a disabled person get dressed, playing a musical instrument in front of an audience, taking care of sick animals, etc etc etc.

I hate them ALL! None of these activities excite me. Because having a job is always about what others expect of you. But mental illness sucks so much of your energy that there is so little left for the job.

Like if I'm a cashier, my high anxiety and depression and the various thoughts and emotions and physical symptoms I experience will take so much of my energy to control and nothing left to put on a smile and make a customer feel welcome and at the same time do my job of scanning items very quickly and correctly.

That's why I've been trying to find jobs that are just online and things I can do on my own time, so that whenever the damned mental health issues give me a break then I can do the job. The problem is there are too many people doing these jobs and they pay so little that I've had to start looking at other options.

"Just venting Wanna preface this by saying that I'm not diagnosed nor do I self-diagnose. It's just that I can relate to some of the symptoms and people here, and I'm wondering if anyone can relate to my feelings.

I feel insane sometimes. I feel really neurotic, paranoid, insecure, and immature sometimes. When I don't think about memories or people that upset me, I'm fine. These past few months I've been slowly recovering from this horrible depression that's plagued me for a while, but in these past few days it's been returning as I start thinking about these bad memories again.

I feel traumatized and like I'm a victim of something I can't understand. Like I'm alone in this pain. The thing is that my ""trauma"" is really just a dozen or so bad interactions I had in my old circle of friends. In particular, there was this one person who I had a handful of unpleasant interactions with. These were mostly brief exchanges that shouldn't have affected me as much as they did, but they felt really, sincerely resentful and unwarranted. What did I do? I didn't know how to stand up for myself, and nobody did for me.

This person lashed out at me, calling me insecure and afraid a couple of times, and said some horrible things about people with my disability. They're ableist and, honestly, that group as a whole was too. Not out of malicious intent but ignorance.

This person wasn't wrong, but the way they treated me didn't help. Seeing those criticisms mirrored by others a couple of times made me feel even more weak, because I knew I was being talked about behind my back. And when I did eventually see how this person talked about me behind my back, it felt nasty and unwarranted.

Still though, it feels so fucking stupid man. I don't know why I let this hurt me. It's been months since I stopped talking to those friends, a few years since those bad exchanges occured, and it still affects me. I never met a person who exhibited such resentment for me in my life, seemingly for no justifiable reason. It really hurt my self-esteem and it still does.

When I think about those friends for too long I start to say things like ""I wanna die"" to myself, like a tic. It's so stupid and I feel like a horrible person for this. For feeling such disproportionate hurt over a dozen or so bad memories. When I don't think about this stuff I begin to feel more ""normal"" again though.

Sorry that this is so long but I'm just wondering if anyone can relate. If not, sorry for wasting your time. I hope this isn't considered off-topic since I'm undiagnosed. But yeah, I feel really pathetic about this side of myself. Maybe I'm just highly neurotic, I don't know. I just wish I could understand what's wrong with me.",Personality disorder

"To preface, this probably belongs only in a diary or in the depths of the folds in my mind… This might be a mess. How are you supposed to tell somebody, be it a mental health provider or a friend to confide in, that you’d rather be dead than have to live with bipolar disorder? I’m NOT suicidal. I’m just exhausted. The help I’ve received has been minimal at best. My original diagnosis was 10+ years ago, and the treatment was and still is a joke. 

I was never the best patient, but my doctor told me that I was the bipolar poster child. 

I lived at home with my single mother, who moved to a different apartment at least once a year. She was a victim of domestic violence. The incident occurred around 2004, and this man (the abuser) played a minimal role in her life in the following 13 years. Even though he’s out of her life completely now, she will still “play the victim card”, as she’s likely consumed by thoughts of the event. That being said, she refuses to confront her trauma. She played little to no part in helping me get any help for my mental illnesses or her own. 

Due to constantly moving, when I could get any kind of professional treatment, it was never long lasting. I wasn’t able to stay in therapy/psychiatry and I surely wasn’t able to stay on a medication long enough to tell if it was beneficial or not. This led to episodes of mania and depression that then led to hospitalizations that shattered my trust in everyone. 

My mother moved out of the apartment we lived in when I was 17. From that time until I was 20, I rapidly cycled through manic, hypomanic, psychotic manic, and crippling depressive episodes with great intensity. I wasn’t able to tell where the mania ended and the depression began. I was mostly manic, which meant I didn’t need treatment because I felt like a god; completely untouchable. I got arrested, lost my job, and totaled my car. My mother had put me up in my own one-bedroom apartment. After losing my job, I didn’t have any income with which to pay my rent. I lost the apartment, too, and ended up homeless. 

I started to get back on my feet with a lot of help from friends, family, and my boyfriend at the time. I started self-medicating with cannabis and the symptoms actually started to subside for a little while. I certainly won’t say that it’s an effective treatment method for bipolar disorder because I was still cycling, but I wasn’t moving through episodes so quickly. For the past 5 years, I’ve noticed annual depressive episodes with shorter, less severe hypo/manic episodes. 

I currently have a psychiatrist whose not willing to give me anything other than Abilify and Hydroxyzine, which is basically just Benadryl, but at least it helps me sleep at night. 
I’m on the waitlist for therapy, with no openings in the next 90 days, at least. 
I have a stable job, steady income, a car, and a place to live. I try to get to the gym 3 times a week. I do yoga almost every day. Things should feel better, but they don’t. 

I’m tired of taking care of myself. I’m tired of babying my mental health. I’m tired of trying to learn about bipolar disorder on my own because nobody ever educated me about my diagnosis. I do not have it in my anymore to keep doing all of this.",Bipolar

"Changing diagnosis? No longer bipolar? Hi,

I was first diagnosed with bipolar type 2 in 2019. I quickly got stable with medication until I was pregnant in 2021 and my meds were changed. It set me spiralling and I saw a new psychiatrist who again diagnosed bipolar type 2.

"My 20th birthday is on the 31st of July. I will not make it. I am very certain I am going to kill myself in the next few days. Probably today. Weirdly, I am at peace with it. I have wanted to kill myself since I was about 12. Anxiety and depression are just words to us now. We hear them everyday. We joke about it. Hell, I constantly joke about it. that is precisely why we are so uncertain of ourselves when we really do feel weak, when we really do suffer from mental illnesses. Because us, this modern world, has learned to destroy all things relative to an emotion. We really are depressed. We really do need help. But joking about it will always be a lot more fun than actually expressing how we feel. It gets to that point where you cannot even face your own siblings. When you cannot look at your own mother. When the feeling of shame that you do not really know how it built, overtakes you and you feel worthless. Unwanted. Every small insult will start to hurt you. Every joke will burn and tear at your skin. Its soon going to be all you hear when you stare at yourself through a mirror. Your own words may bring you down. Joking will not be funny anymore. But its too late- the next generation has already starting joking about it too.Being the funny person you are known to be will not be enough anymore. People will count on you for the jokes but you will not have them- you have lost all your humor. Its been torn away. You feel hungry but staring at your food is somehow the only thing you can do. And when you eventually eat it, all you can think about it how you should not have eaten it. How you are gaining weight. How all those compliments on your weight loss from your family will disappear and the ugly stares will come back. that is all you are known for, is not it? The things you never wanted to do. The starving yourself, the physical and mental stress you put yourself through for those marks, the crying at 5am because you cannot find the willpower to just stop thinking and sleep. The compliments wavering in and out of your head, the insults joining in. You do not know how it feels to have your own mother relentlessly insult and bring your self confidence down from a young age. You do not know how it feels to have absolutely, literally, nobody to talk to. You do not know how it feels to have your own parents beg you to be more like the other familys daughter. You do not know how it feels to not remember the last time you hugged, kissed, or even touched your own parent. You do not know how it feels to be told by your blood, your birthgiver, the woman who you wish you could respect and love, that you are unwanted. A mistake. The should have been a boy.I have never told my parents I loved them and they have never told me that either. My father is a depressed alcoholic whose parents are now both dead, and my mother is a raging, manipulative, bipolar narcissist who can never admit when she is at fault. She has always hated me. Never really knew or understood why. Guess I just was not a necessary child. I do not really have anything to offer. I am the ugliest kid, the weirdest, loudest, loser. It hurts when even your parents think you are a fucking joke. I have siblings but I doubt they will miss me too much. I am sure a tear might come to their eye when they think of our few good memories once I am gone, but like my sister once told me after I returned home from a three day trip away: the family is just so much happier without me. My life is wonderful. I have been blessed with utmost things that I do not need yet my parents still bought me them; like an Ipod when I was a kid. I am thankful. I am. I have no reason to complain. Everytime my mouth opens and I start to complain, or even think of complaining, I feel like killing myself. I do not deserve this life. The life that I have deserves to be given to a young boy or girl, unprivileged in a broken, impoverished society. They could have made much better use of this life than I have. I do not deserve anything good.Well, this is it. This is not really a suicide note, I guess, but I do not really think I have the energy to write one.

"What is this Feeling? So occasionally, I'll have this moment. I'll think of something from my past, maybe one of the times I went to a water park as a child, maybe seeing fireworks, a carnival I went to with my first steady girlfriend, maybe it's even a song from Melissa Ethridge's ""Yes I Am"", the first album I remember listening to (specifically Silent Legacy for some reason). Maybe my thoughts are on little kid me catching tadpoles with my mom's friend's kids. Or the countless sunsets I have been mesmerized by. Or the time I went to Dave and Buster's with my parents and they dropped me off at McDonald's on the way home and I played Monopoly on my iPod when I was a senior in high school. In any case, I'll look back at it and begin to choke up. It usually happens when I'm alone, maybe in a dark room, playing a game or just wandering about my mind, and these thoughts appear and it's a mixture of missing it and this dread of what's approaching.

I can remember doing this all my life, having these thoughts and these feelings. I've described it as my bittersweet struggle with nostalgia, but my girlfriend doesn't think that's it. As an adult, I think it's longing for a time where the events were great, a realization that said event will probably never happen again or at least won't be the same. I start to cry most of the time, but it isn't like I'm in a bad spot. As I said, this has happened throughout my life. And they're seemingly random events, most of them happy, despite whatever was happening. Like that first girlfriend I mentioned? A little abusive, nothing hardcore. The occasional genuine ""you're an idiot"", or the time she slapped me so hard I fell off my bed. But I think of when we went to an anime convention and I get sad. I still go to that convention, but for some reason this bitter sadness washes over me. And there's other little things I could pepper into these thoughts like this. But it always seems like I was happy, I miss the event, if I can go back to the location or event in current day it will be different, and I'm afraid of what's coming ahead in life.

I'm only 27, so I don't want to believe these instances are some sort of midlife crisis. If I had to give a pattern, these thoughts and feelings occur about once a month. Is this what nostalgia is supposed to feel like? What's the word for these feelings?",Stress

"Dealing with the Critics in Your Life Whatever you’re trying to achieve - save the world, write a novel, devote yourself to a particular cause – there are likely to be those who will be critical. Some people just have a critical disposition while others will take issue with the specifics of your particular endeavour. Criticism is unavoidable. Your choice is in how to respond to it. 

### Consider these strategies for managing the critics in your life:

**Clarify your purpose.** As humans, we are compelled to make meaning. Making meaning for ourselves – and value for others – is fundamental to a life well lived. When you’re doing something very important to you, you care far less about the criticisms of others. If they can easily throw you off your path, you might want to reflect on how important it really is to you. Are you living your purpose consistent with you values?

**Understand the critic’s motivation.** Are they projecting themselves in to the situation – their aspirations, their skill set, their propensity for risk, their values? Are they genuinely trying to protect you from any potential down-sides? Are they trying to maintain the status quo – for you, them or both? Are they masking their own lack of action? 

**Recognise that criticism is not balanced appraisal.** We have evolved to notice negative issues more readily than positive ones. We are more likely to notice criticism than encouragement: people working against us over people supporting us. Most people are actually indifferent to you and your life so get on and live it.

**Realize that you’re going to be criticized no matter what you do.** Whether you become a billionaire, movie star, teacher, doctor, or sit on the couch all day, there is someone that will tell you that you’re doing the wrong thing. So, live your life building towards what you do want rather than what the critics don’t want.

**Respond calmly.** Rather than giving your critics the pleasure of an emotional response, respond kindly with a considered response. Acknowledge any leaps of faith you are making. 

**Use your critics as motivation.** While some people are intimidated and deflated by the critics of the world, others are able to use the negative comments as a source of motivation. Remind yourself that while the critics are standing on the sidelines, you are on the pitch and playing the game.

**Decide if they have something useful to say.** Some criticism may carry valid points – explore these with your critic and ask what their solution would be – the response differentiates between useful and harmful dialogue. If the criticism isn’t useful, move on. You have more important things to do.

**Take criticism as a compliment.** Most people will leave you alone if you’re struggling or aren’t doing anything noteworthy. You only become a significant target of negative comments if you’re doing well. If you’re taking a lot of heat, you must be doing something correct!

**Live your life without the need for the approval of others.** Live your own life, by your own values. Use your signature strengths to create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future in your chosen pursuit. 

I hope you took something useful from this piece; I have posted a further series of quick reads on my own little corner of Reddit – would be great to see you there.",Stress

"Tired of needing “Communication Skills” to survive in this world. As someone with a speech impediment (Childhood Apraxia of Speech) and (currently undiagnosed) AVPD, along with selective mutism, It’s frustrating that this whole society seems to be based off social interaction. I’m almost 18 and realized that I should be looking for a (temporary) job by then so I’m not a complete failure living in their parents house (no offense to anyone who does, I set high standards for myself.) I see everyone else around my age and younger getting the easiest jobs where they literally just have to sit at a cash register all day and they get some good money. It’s frustrating me to my core as I can never get an easy job like them as I can’t handle social interaction or talking. I try to look for alternative jobs but every single one of them pops up with “Requires excellent communication skills” or “Verbal communication required.” Even working as a stocker or in a kitchen apparently requires communication! For the life of me I can not communicate well with people as I automatically freeze up and go into panic mode inside. Even at the small school I volunteer at I can barely even force out a word, I just do my job silently before leaving. They probably are only letting me help out of pity. I even considered being a police officer for a while until I realized that you needed communication for that too. I’m more fucking scared of talking to people then of tackling down murders. Today my girlfriend was looking for tutoring jobs and I just cried seeing how easy it is for her and everyone else not having to even care about social interaction.

"Being a ghost would be my ideal form of existence. I really enjoy watching people live their lives, listening indirectly to their conversations while in public, being an observer of events etc. My problem is having to interfere on the world, I hate having to talk and to do things that will have consequences in it. I wish I could just watch life like a tv show or as if I was a ghost, in a way that no one could see me, nothing would be expected of me and I wouldn't need to worry because I would be certain of it. I could just contemplate the world in peace.

Some of you guys may have watched Euphoria and I definitely feel a connection with the description made about Lexi, how she felt like she was an just observer and that her life was not really her life, just some sort of play or movie.

These days I been having the classic ""I want to leave all behind and live in the woods with just a dog"" idea and daydreams, and I guess that a big part of it is because I feel like there I could be like this, or at least similar enough. Be an observer of nature, never having to deal with socialization again, only brief interactions for, let's say, buy necessary stuff from other people (which I don't mind). I know this isn't realistic for my context and also that it probably wouldn't be this magical thing, but it's a fantasy that brings me satisfaction.

I guess I'm just burned out of people. A lot of bad things happened in my relational and social life since childhood till last year and I'm really bitter about it right now. Of course I want to find real connection, where I could be myself openly and comfortably, but because it always goes wrong and brings disappointments I'm really hopeless at this point and honestly kinda angry.

"I am so tired of being stepped on and hurt. When I try to open up about my feelings with my mom I just get lectured and yelled at about how ungrateful I am and how I do not realize how good I have it. One time I just came home from school and she started screaming at me for something that was out of my control, and when I broke down crying, all my stepdad said was stop. The first time I tried to date, it ended with me on a call with the suicide hotline because she threatened to kill herself when I did not fight to stay with her. I only knew her for two days. The first person i kissed, the first person I cuddled with, the first person to say ""I love you"" to me, the first person I felt comfortable saying ""I love you"" to, turned his back and ostracized me from our mutual friends when I relapsed into self harm. My father sexually assaulted me while drunk when I was 12 and I still live with the repercussions. I could not even do my laundry because I had a mental breakdown. I could not stop reliving it. I could not stop thinking about how it affected my confidence and sense of self worth and still fucking does. All I could do was curl up against the fucking wall and try not to cry. I used to be terrified of people finding out somehow and I was scared that they would think that that was my awakening if i was ever outed. My only friend throughout high school does not ever ask me how I am doing and i cannot talk about being gay around him. He gets pissed or says he would not f me when i talk about it. Fuck, I cannot even meme about it without him arguing with me. My other friends, who do not know how bad this hurts, make jokes about how I used to force myself to be straight. They say things like ""remember when you tried to be straight? lol."" As if I could forget. As if I could forget the dozens of fucking times I locked myself in my bathroom with my knife for it. As if I could forget staring at myself in the mirror and wondering what the fuck is wrong with me. Maybe something is wrong with me... I do not know.

"15 year old, Sophomore suffering from Health Anxiety ever since I was in elementary school. It's been inherently worse ever since I tried marijuana last summer. Haven't tried no other drugs since but still. It was a bad trip, i had wayy too much.

Current fears that have come and gone:

-Heart Attack
-Heart arrhythmia
-Cancer (Brain)
-ALS or some motor-neuron disease

My current goals are to gain more muscle and be overall more athletic. I want to get rid of my fat and gain muscle. And consequently after sitting in front of a screen for pretty much all of my life i have gained little to no muscle and am extremely weak. So for the past year i started with going for runs around my block and lifting small weights. Then when I got better I jogged for longer periods of time and got a bench press and heavier weights. So I have been lifting weights 6x a week and doing some cardio here and there. I hope i'm not overtraining. but now that my resting heart rate has dramatically decreased (went from 70-80bpm to now about 40-50bpm while resting) 

Scary shit. i don't want it to lower anymore... I'm scared it will just stop while i'm asleep cause it will go too slow and i will die. Irrational? Probably. Impossible?

They get angry over the littlest things to the point where I do not feel comfortable talking to them about myself. Not only that, but Jesus I felt extremely uncomfortable with my whole family being there with my friend. I have learned to just listen to what they say and stay away from friends.

"Speaking in front of school soon. Help, please. I’m two weeks, I am set to speak in front of my entire school about my struggles with depression as a bigger part of an outreach day the school leadership is planning. I intend to discuss the struggle that is depression, tell my personas story, and finally send two big messages about mental illness to my school. I’d like to first address those who may suffer from mental illness and help them to know that there can be hope. That I understand how much it forces you to feel worthless and isolate yourself, but that if we all can learn to help one another, we can begin to not be alone. The other is to address those who may hold a stigma against mental illness or simply don’t know how to help at all. I would love it if y’all here at r/BipolarReddit could give me some feedback and overall relay to me what some of the most important things need to be addressed in regard to mental health.

Here’s a few questions to guide your feedback if you’d like to answer them. If not, feel free to share some thoughts and ideas with me it’d be much appreciated. Love y’all. It’s hard. I know.

1. As a person who suffers from mental illness, what does it help to hear? What helps to give you hope?
2. How can others help?
3. What’s one thing you think people need to better understand about mental illness and bipolar disorder?
4. What do you wish for in the future for the mental health community?
5. What do you think I really need to relay to other people who may be suffering from mental illness?

"Dog died on New Years, scared of rabies Okay so I posted this on the anxiety subreddit and that should of been enough but my anxiety still is being awful so uh-- posting this here too since health anxiety is a big one for be in general anyway...? Sorry ;;;

Basically, I had an old dog, like 14 years old. He started sleeping a lot more around Christmas, and all, and when I cold front blew in that week, he started having a harder time walking around (he'd been wobbly already), and then Thursday he collapsed on his front legs and couldn't eat back up. His front legs couldn't move, but back legs were fine, and he ate and drank what we gave him fine. 

During that Thursday I absent minded lot scratched the inside of my nose after doing something and he licked, which is what started the paranoia.

My poor dog couldn't move, but his back legs still could--- and his jaw never got paralyzed and he never got the excess salivating deal.

We have him pain meds at a vets advice, which seemed to of gotten his front legs working again, still back legs working too, he just couldn't get up yet. But he was moving more, his head too. He even ate that day. Unfortunately, he started bloating, fell into a coma, and died that day, which was New Years.

I've brought my paranoia up with the vet, and he did say with everything I told him and showed him that rabies shouldn't even be a concern. Another commenter seemed to agree too.

And--- yeah, I know better--- he wasn't even paralyzed in that way, it was the pain in his bones--- the pain meds helped him, in those final moments. And he never had a hanging mouth, he could move it and eat fine, and didn't foam or excessively salivate or anything. But even still, I've been absolutely paranoid every since despite knowing better. Despite knowing that wouldn't of been rabies, since if it was his limbs wouldn't of gotten better--- but my mind keeps telling me what if it is, what if it is--- what if it's too late and you'll have it and your mom will have it and you'll die--

"Its been a long time since I have cried. Its been even longer since I have truly had the urge to care about something. When I was in the 10th grade, I tried a percocet for the first time with a group of my friends. It was that moment that haunts my life to this day. I upgraded to straight fentanyl after a while, and it became apparent that I did not make enough to afford my addiction. After ruining about all of my relationships by either stealing or borrowing money from my closest family and friends, I went on to ask random strangers Id see at the gas station or distant colleagues. My life was shit before the drug usage. Parents divorced, dad a drug addict, mom a whore, and me a bipolar, anxious, scared person- there was not an absolute reason I should not be using in my mind. After a couple of years of failed attempts of being off and on sober, I decided I was going to end it all. However, that did not work. My tolerance was to a point that made it very difficult to OD on. On my final attempt, however, I bought 30 pills. Stimulus check helped me there. I drove to a spot that was public so my body would be found, and I snorted 15 of those pills. After woken by police, it was obvious that did not work the way I wanted it to. Court ordered to rehab, I went through the entire 3 month program flawlessly. Using my previous knowledge of rehabilitations spit outs, and a some what will to make myself better, I came out feeling sad. I knew Id miss my peers and even some of the counselors.

"Constantly “checking” for signs of brain problem Hey, guys. So this is a little difficult to explain, so hopefully I can describe it as cohesively as possible. So, a couple months ago I developed a little obsession with misreading things. I misread a couple of words and immediately began to think “there is something wrong with my brain”. Well now, it’s manifested itself in just about everything. In a bizarre way to prove I do/don’t have a problem, I’ve begun subconsciously “checking” every thing I read and hear to see if I made a mistake. For instance, I’ll skim a headline really fast online, then get frustrated when I misread it (even though I didn’t carefully read it). Because I’m now “checking” every single word I read and hear, I’m constantly misreading, mishearing and misunderstanding things, because I’m focusing on each individual word and not the sentence as a whole. It’s mentally exhausting and is effecting my reasoning skills and memory, which of course, is fueling my health anxiety as it further “proves” I have something wrong with me. 

Of course, occupying my mind with this causes me to make many, many mistakes which- you guessed it- fuels it more.

"Addictions and how the heck to quit A little background about myself. My name is Michael. I am 28 years old and live in the USA. I have been diagnosed with bipolar for 8 months but lord knows ive been bipolar all my life. I have 2 addictions, they are video games and weed. They basically run my life. I have friends who do them but they aren't addicted, they're functioning adults even though they smoke and/or play video games. Some thoughts on this; What is the cycle of addiction and bipolar? Maybe it is that at some point in the cycle, you need help mentally, like anything to feel good because you're in the depressive part of the cycle, or maybe you're in the manic part and HAVE to do something ""cool"" and ""fun"" so either way you go to your addiction, your life force, what keeps you here. Then because of this and through this, you're addicted to something.

&amp;#x200B;

But like, so what? I'm just speaking out loud here, but I love my addictions. I don't want to quit them. I play league of legends, and smoke weed. I love doing it. Am I really happy while doing those two things? Deep down, I know the answer is ""not really"", BUT AT LEAST I am not drowning in despair. My addictions keep me from going over the deep end, they are what make life ""okay"". Isn't it acceptable to use these things for my own benefit? 

&amp;#x200B;

However this brings me to my next thought. Do I over-use them? I play league for like, 7 hours a day on average. I smoke CONSTANTLY. I'm high right now as I type this. At work. Was late because I woke and toked, played League for 2 hours, THEN came to work. My boss isn't happy with me. My addictions are a hindrance to my life, as you can see. 

&amp;#x200B;

Are video games and weed ruining my life? Probably. Will I regret it someday? I already do, and will probably continue to further regret they're use as I get older. But they're also saving me.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore I, like any other addict out there, don't know what to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

If I decide to quit.

1. Will life be bleak and dull or will it refill itself with other things? 

2. Will I just find a new addiction? I heard it's impossible to ""quit"" addictions, one has to REPLACE addictions. 

3. When I am drowning in bipolar, which is often, what do I use as a crutch instead of my addictions. I use video and games to ESCAPE! I escape from reality all the time because it is so vicious for me because I am bipolar. I see the world as hell, everything is horrible because I am depressed. When I am in this place, and I need to run away and can't use my addictions anymore, what do I do? That is the time when I would relapse, not knowing what to do but needing something to help me escape my problems. 

&amp;#x200B;

4. What about quitting addictions would improve my life?

I look at this as a cost/benefit ratio question. Simply put; is the cost of quitting my addictions worth all the work it will be? I will be missing out 100% on the things that I ""love"", being League of Legends and marijuana, and I will have to put in a lot of work finding new things to spend my life doing. And I probably wont find them as much fun as my addictions! Fuck that man, why the hell should I quit? What makes it worth it? I can't find an answer man. ",Bipolar

"Does avpd stem from childhood trauma? Hi lovely community! I’m quite new on this forum! And just wondered if the origin of this is similar to what people refer to as an avoidant attachment style in which a lot of sources claim it’s due to neglect from parents in early childhood.

What triggers avpd or what is the kind of trauma that sparks it? From what I’ve read so far it’s not something you are born with but rather develops with age?

"Is this all life is supposed to be? I know life is supposed to be difficult. I know stressful things can happen, and that most of us learn how to cope in a healthy way. Eating right and exercising are supposed to make us healthy and happy, both physically and mentally. We're supposed to have hobbies (beginner at knitting) to keep us occupied and to do our duties, which manifests in the job that I do almost every day. We need to have a network of support from friends and family. Life isn't just what happens to you, it's how you react to it. That's what I tell myself.

Yet it seems that life, or at least my life, is just one stressful event after another. Be it getting rear-ended and struggling with insurance for a few months, a single parent's boyfriend showing up who stresses you out for the next few, transferring from one branch to another in your job, looming deadlines, and the knowledge that you have to eat healthily and sleep at least 8 hours a night or you're going to get sick...etc. etc. etc. Many times I'm happy and I catch myself wondering when the next bad thing is going to happen. WITHOUT FAIL, it does. I deal with it successfully, and it's on to the next one! Over and over and over again, catching moments of pleasure and peace in between. It's not a very good comparison, but it's kind of like Dark Souls, where you die your way through instead of playing your way through.

I'm slowly being chipped away at. I've built an extraordinarily healthy way of living, but it seems at this point that it's just a tower I've built over a foundation under continuous assault by the elements that I'm constantly repairing.

I've been tired. So tired. It's like I died a long time ago, and I'm only 23. I know everybody deals with constant stressors, so is everyone secretly feeling this way? Is it all drowned in alcohol? drugs? Religion? Are we supposed to naturally numb ourselves with age? This can't be all that life is!

My grandfather eats junk food. He stands or sits around for most of the day and sometimes he goes for a walk before coming home and eating. He's been through the Vietnam war and lost almost everything. Despite sleep apnea, cancer, a fat-rich diet, and falling once, he's still thriving in his eighties. No one gets to that point unless they've got it all figured out inside.

There's something obvious I'm missing, something that appears to make all the difference. I don't think a girlfriend will fix this, nor will any big purchases or materialism. Ideally, I'd have a life of inner peace and contentment, filled with steady but peaceful determination. Otherwise, life has no meaning to it.",Stress

"Stress when working It's hard to explain, I'm guessing its some sort of stress, but I can't figure out how to get over it.  A little background.  Before the beginning of Covid Lockdowns (like right before) I had a major breakdown and went into severe depression.  My sister was about to go through a life saving organ transplant (which went well), I had someone break up with me, I had 2 major career defining projects I was leading that weren't going well, and I was suffering from a torn labrum which stopped me from doing a hobby I loved.  All of this happening in the span of about a week.

It took me a long time to get out of my depression.  I took medication, stopped worrying as much about having a great career, learned meditation and practiced it daily, found a new hobby, and tried enjoying life more over the span of the pandemic.  I decided to make it a point to get away from my previous job as it caused me a major amount of stress.  They overworked me, and the pay wasn't great for the amount of responsibilities put on my shoulders.

It took me nearly 1.5 years to finally land a new job and leave that job behind.  I have fantastic bosses at my new job, they pay me well and make sure that I'm compensated for my overtime whenever that is necessary (which isn't often).  The only complaint I have about my job is it's a bit boring and not very challenging (or at least it shouldn't be).

Now here's my major problem.  I'm falling behind on my work and not learning at the speed I use to when starting a new job.  I'm having difficulties learning all the systems and parts even though most of my job is just surveying equipment, and designing simple parts and cable assemblies.

Every time I start on a new task or job, I start experiencing a dull stress and what I think is ""brain fog"".  It feels like the top of my brain just hardens, and I get a mild headache.  Over the day it drains me, but once I get off work I start quickly recovering.

I use to thrive doing challenging work and continually learning new things in my field.  Now I just feel tired all the time.  I'm tired of feeling like this.  I've asked for more challenging tasks from my boss and I get them, but it doesn't help.

i'm usually pretty fine about this. i don't crave intimacy or friendship and am pretty content by myself. but sometimes it just hits me how screwed i am. a family member had surgery recently and i texted them to see how they were doing. that resulted in them trying to have a conversation, what with them being on bedrest and all, but my responses were so... bad. they seemed to think so too, because they stopped replying, haha. i can't blame them in the least for it, too. i wish it wasn't this way, but i don't think there's much i can do about it either. this blankness, it feels like it'll be there forever. like some kind of inpenetrable fog muffling my thoughts, blocking off any higher function.

But whenever I have conversations with a group of people I’m comfortable with, like my family, I feel like I suck at having conversations.

"This is a long story. Last August I ran away from my home. I did this because of a few reasons. The first was because I had been messing around with about 20 girls from all over the world and making them think that they were the only ones. My parents found out and were understandably angry. Over the course of the next week, I was miserable because I had to deal with the ramifications of it. Finally, I snapped at my dad, and he snapped at me. It ended with me on the floor and his punching me. That night I packed a bag and ran away from everything, my family, my problems, and just my life. Over the next 24 hours, I had spent $525 to get up north where a friend was living. When I got there, he, and few of his friends, and I went out for a bit and we ended up getting pulled over. The cop smelled weed in the car and took our names. He registered my name and saw I was a missing person, and brought me back to the station and called my parents. Forcing me to go back, they took every device I had and cut me off from the rest of the world. I had not been able to talk to my friend since, nor have I gone to my old school since. When I got back, they sent me to live with some close friends in the country. While I was there, I was absolutely miserable. I had no friends, no family, and no phone either. I also could run because I had nowhere to run to. I stayed there from September till December before they decided to move to Hawaii. Because of this, I had to move back. Since I have been home I have had no friends, no devices besides an old computer, and no money because I have to pay off some things to my parents. I feel lonely, and like I am trapped. The sad part is that I felt my happiest when I was on the run because I did not have any expectations of myself. I could be whoever I wanted to be. Now in July, nearly a full year since, and I am the most depressed I have ever been. I have no freedom. I get what I did was bad, but I was also a stupid 16-year-old kid who wanted attention and love. I was not a popular kid, and I never had any close friends except for the one that I was going to live with, but I do not have a way to talk to him anymore. I cannot call Suicide Prevention because I do not have a phone, and I cannot talk to a close friend because I do not have any. I cannot talk to my parents because they will say it is because of the choices I have made. I am just so tired and lonely. I am just so done with life. I do not know if this is a cry for help or my last words. I am laying in my room with a ring of knives around me. I do not know what to do anymore. I do not know what to do anymore",Suicidal

"My therapist broke my heart all over again In November, I went on a trip with a friend. This triggered a manic episode. I was a god awful person to my then boyfriend. I knew I needed to fix myself, so I went to my psych, asked for a med switch, made an appointment with a new therapist, all that jazz.

My actions were just not something my boyfriend could move past. And I don't blame him. I was inconsiderate of his feelings at a delicate time and really hurt him. He broke up with me at the end of January.

I told my therapist all about the breakup, all the issues we had, all the fights we had, but I also told her about all the wonderful things. Those were so much more important things to me than any disagreement. We left that topic for a while to work on other things. In my appointment today, we circled back. She said ""it honestly sounds like you two would have been a perfect match if mental illness wasn't as big an issue as it was."" This broke my heart. I have been trying to forget about it, leave well enough alone, or just understand the fact that he's never coming back, and I'll never get to talk to him again (we ended with no contact).

Now I'm sitting in my car in the parking lot in my car, trying to compose myself before heading back to work. And normally I could just hide in my office and cry, but I'm getting trained to run new machines this week so I have no where to hide.

"Want to resign from my job Hey all, I’m really struggling at the moment and all I can think about is resigning from my role. I’m a social worker who provides therapy to children/adolescents with complex mental health difficulties. 

I’ve been working at the organisation for 11 months now and roughly a week ago I changed my workplace location to be closer to home. It’s the same service just a different location. Oh .. and I’m acting in a senior position at the new workplace as part of a six month secondment. 

I thought that starting fresh would make me feel more motivated and confident, however, I’m still feeling like an imposter, scared and worried about criticism. Extremely terrified of social interactions too. Just knowing I have to see clients and speak to them gives me major anxiety. I’m also on antidepressants and beta blockers which help a bit but I still dread the work that I have to do.

All I keep thinking about is waking up in the morning, switching off my mobile phone and driving far away to a relaxing environment like a beach, pretending I have no responsibilities or cares in the world. I know that’s not possible though.

If I did resign I would make sure never to find a therapy role again as it’s not something I’m too keen on and social interactions terrify me.

"Changing meds is never easy Since I’ve been stable I am weaning off klonopin. I’ve done it before and it’s not the most fun thing but tolerable.

At the same time I’m starting vyvanse for binge eating. I was already doing weight watchers and since September I’ve lost 21 lbs, but I’ve got about 70 more to go - this is a result of an episode that was triggered by going through a lot of life changes in a short period of time. The weight has caused me to have severe social anxiety. 

My doctor has known me since before I gained the weight and knows what a struggle it’s been. She knows this weight is not normal for me but as a result of the self-medicating with food. I see her again in a week or so since medications are changing.

The vyvanse is helping so much regarding I was always sleeping during the day on weekends, I never had any energy, plus I’m not binge eating as often. But I’m getting emotional again. 

My main symptom isn’t panic, but is crying. I cry and cry when I’m unstable. It’s creeping up on me. I’m afraid if I tell my doctor she will stop the vyvanse and it’s helping me so much. But I also know how important it is to be honest with your doctor.

"it is very difficult with so many people in the house. Yet I am certain in my belief that this is the thing to do. I do not want to trudge through a boring meaningless life. I have no friends, everything is really a mundane mess. There are two principle means through which this end goal could be achieved . Either through hanging which I would not do unless I was certain that whatever contraption I had constructed would work in the intended manner, or else driving my car in to a body of water, the nearby river would do the trick.Hanging seems to appeal more to me, the latter seems to be quite a terrifying thing to attempt. Although it would eliminate the chance of chickening out, and if it achieved the same end goal then a few minutes of panicking should not be the dealbreaker.I am a huge loser. The must frustrating thing is that there are small things that could have been changed at 13-14 which would have completely changed the trajectory of this life. I am not depressed, I have just come to the conclusion that the continuation of my life would be a fruitless endeavor and I see no point in continuing as it will just become more and more pathetic. I am 20 years of age and a huge loser.People are always recommending things like Therapy, and some people(on the internet only ,nobody IRL would even suspect I am at this stage) have recommended medication. The problem is, that these things make sense if there is something worth salvaging. Someone can become a complete mess at 20, for several years on drugs for instance, but recover. That is the case if they are built on a firm foundation, there is no foundation and the entire structure is rotten.

"Will You Take Medications For The Rest of Your Life? It’s been 2 years since I was hospitalized for a manic/psychotic episode where I was diagnosed with bipolar. Over the course of 5 months post-hospitalization I tried a myriad of medical concoctions including lithium, abilify, latuda, and many others whose name I’ve since forgotten. Whether due to the depressive episode that came directly after my manic one or the terrible side effects I decided I would go off medications.

So now it’s been 19 months since I’ve taken any medications. I’ve avoided drugs, alcohol, and other stressors. I make sure to sleep 8-10 hours a day, eat healthy, drink lots of water, workout, meditate, etc. and it seems like I’ve been stable. I still get occasional periods of depression which I easily ride out or bursts of hypomania which makes life easier however all delusions/serious effects have all but disappeared.

I recognize however that can be an illusion and at any point, things can spin outside of my control. So recently I got a pdoc to write a prescription for Latuda, however, I haven’t picked up the medication yet because I’m starting to question whether I should get back on it.

This is primarily because I feel like the effects of long-term medication use can have irreversible consequences on the brain. It doesn’t help that we have had 0 longitudinal studies showing the effects of staying on these medications for 20+ years (if there are, I'd love to see them!). So given that I’m currently stable, I am having a hard time convincing myself to start taking medications indefinitely. I understand some people cannot function without their medication, however, I’m lucky to not be part of that cohort (for now).

Anyways I’m not advocating that anyone stop taking medications but I am curious how others view this topic, do you intend on sticking with medications for the rest of your life?",Bipolar
"7 Tips to Deal with Stress Today is Stress Awareness Day so I want to share some statistics and resources available for people suffering from stress:

&amp;#x200B;

* The most common cause of stress is work-related stress with 79% saying they frequently felt it. (Statista)😓
* 74% of people feel so stressed they have been overwhelmed or unable to cope. (Mental Health Foundation and YouGov)😦
* 13.7 million working days are lost each year in the UK because of work-related stress, anxiety and depression, costing £28.3 billion yearly. (NICE) 🤯

Tips to Deal with  Stress:  
\-**Explore your triggers**: Keep a diary for one week to discover which situations increase your stress levels the most.  
\-**Practice time management**: Trying to do everything at once isn't an effective way to handle stress as it usually takes you longer to complete your tasks. Ensure that you are organised by managing your time efficiently.  
**-Set boundaries:** It's easy to be available 24 hours a day due to current technology. Establish some boundaries so work is distanced from your personal life.  
**-Life outside of work:** To avoid experiencing burnout you must take some time to look after yourself and engage in activities you enjoy.  
**-Build a support network:** Speaking with and meeting up with friends and family can help you feel more positive and reduce your vulnerability to stress.  
**-Focus on healthy habits:** Avoid alcohol, caffeine and nicotine, get enough sleep, eat well and be active.

**-Do a course:** There are plenty of courses available that will teach you to understand the symptoms and causes of stress, steps you can take to deal with your stress and will help you practice dealing with stressful situations in the safety of exercises. For example, **VirtualSpeech** is offering a free trial for their Managing Workplace Stress course and **FutureLearn** also offers a Workplace Wellbeing course.",Stress

"I never thought it is possible, but I have a case of mental illness, that is practicaly incurable. it is based on ""only"" severe emotional neglect through childhood (and adulthood) but when it is mixed up with too much responsibility from early age, it becomes incurable.I will explain. Normally in therapy patients are taught to find their inner child and nurture it the way patients have not been nurtured. This gives the restless inner child fixing experiences and after few years of inner child work, mental health gets better. But if you are neglected AND you had to take care of yourself, taking care of your inner child is just playing the trauma again, so it is not healing. It is only retraumatizing.And this mixture means constant panic-like feelings, like what a baby would feel when left on the side of the road. Panic, fear, chaos, eventually deathwish. These feelings might be on the surface or hide in dark, but they are never absent. Therefore I do not sleep. I do not enjoy. I do not connect. I do not love. There is no hope of feeling nurtured or satisfied unless someone else does the parentification. And since I am not adoptable minor, that means never. So do you know any cults with charismatic father-figures? Can be a suicide cult. Incurable mental pain",Suicidal

"How i solved my bipolar disorder. Hello,

Let me get straight to the point. Bipolar and many other mental disorders does not exist. There are only consequences of poisoning your body/mind.

I tought i have bipolar disorder for 2 years, went to psychiatrist, gave me many drugs. Those drugs only destroy you, no drug cant help you.

&amp;#x200B;

How i fixed my bipolar disorder?

\- Stopped eating sugar  
\- Started meditating  
\- Cold showers  
\- Minimize meat consumption

\- Never eat processed meat

\- Dont ever ever take any drug, even for a headache, NOTHING.

\- Stop smoking if you smoke cigarettes (i had biggest improvement when stopped smoking)

\- Dont drink so much alcohol

&amp;#x200B;

And many more things you can do to stop all mental disorders, but these are main that helped me. Im now 1.5 years free of all ""bipolar"" and other disorders. I feel like a god and i have a will to live and achieve my dreams, you can all do it to!!

"Are you a fawn? In Pete Walker's work there are 4 types of trauma responses. Fight, flight, freeze, and the last least spoken about, *fawn*. 

Fawning is just as it sounds. You fawn over people. You people please and bend to their will even if you know it's fucking you over in the long run. 

I feel like being a fawn has caused me to hate people even more than I should lol. Because when people come around, they usually come with some bs that I don't really want anything to do with. 

Wanting favors, wanting me to be their emotional punching bag, wanting validation, wanting talk at me, wanting me to give them stuff etc. I don't have a back bone and it's really hard for me to tell people to kick rocks without feeling guilty

So it just becomes another reason why I isolate myself. Nobody can drag me into their drama if nobody is there to begin with.

"Relentless Nightmare since December! Hello all,

I am 22M and been struggling since December when I had a marijuana induced panic attack. First time smoking and I only did it to make my sister feel more comfortable with smoking since it’s something she enjoys. Like an idiot, I took an absolutely heroic bong rip and had a full mental breakdown for the next 2 hours before I finally woke up and felt mostly normal. I felt okay the next day and then after a week I was very stressed at work and out of nowhere got extremely dizzy to the point I was scared for my life. I drove to the ER and they said it was just anxiety so I drove back home and tried to sleep it off. Didn’t sleep at all for 3 days and was terrified the whole time. Since then I’ve had constant derealization, panic attacks, intrusive thoughts, depression, anxiety, and horrible physical symptoms like dizziness, random headaches that come and go all over my head, body pains, stomach pain, etc..

Since then I’ve had 2 rounds of blood work, CT scan, MRI, seen an ENT, and a neurologist. I’ve also been given all of the following medications and more: prednisone, meclizine, clonidine, zyrtec, flonase, antibiotic ear drops. None have worked. All my tests have shown nothing physically wrong so I’d say it’s fair to diagnose as anxiety-related… though my therapist (I’m new to therapy since this all began) says he’s never had a client with such severe dizziness and brain fog. I’ve been on Zoloft for 6 weeks now and I’d say it is finally helping somewhat. I have changed doses twice from 25 to 50 and 50 to 75 in that time so I’m still adjusting. I was also taking quetiapine 25mg as a sleep aid for a few weeks but I can sleep without it now so I stopped because I wasn’t thrilled about taking an antipsychotic for off-label use to begin with.

Overall I would say I am at about 25-30%. When I started the Zoloft I felt around 0-5% honestly. I was convinced I was going insane and would need to be in an institution during those first 2 weeks.

I have been housebound and on medical leave this whole time so what I’m trying to do to get back to my feet is exercise daily, get outside, drive to my apartment (1hr), and work remote a few hours a day. I am soldiering through these tasks and honestly I do feel better when I’m busy. For example when I play the PlayStation I can push the symptoms to the back of my mind. But the rest of the time it feels like my conscious mind only has 25% awareness while the rest of my mind is lost somewhere else and doing it’s own thing. It also feels like my short term memory and vision are impaired but they’re not. It’s like being stuck in a dreaming state and it’s so scary and frustrating. It’s very hard to describe but I don’t have any delusions or hallucinations so I don’t believe I am suffering from a psychotic illness. 

I have suffered through so much in my life without it physically impeding me or making me question my sanity but these last 3 months have really tested me. Over the last 4 years I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression but I was able to power through 2 degrees, a long distance relationship, a breakup, and building a career I would hardly have dreamed of years ago. I know I am strong and have what it takes to get through this, but the battle is certainly long and difficult. It is unlike anything I’d have ever fathomed a human could experience. It is so overwhelming that it’s easy to think it may never end. I think it will be okay over time, because I believe in the power of the human mind and body to adjust to challenges, but I wanted to share my experience and see what others may think. I will be so grateful when I am healed and healthy because this experience has given me so many insights on what it takes to have a happy and meaningful life. I’ve learned lessons in gratitude, kindness, and compassion that I want to share with others.

P.S.
I really look forward to getting back to the things I enjoy once I’m better: bodybuilding, soccer, vinyls, and working!",Anxiety
"how to get over fear of therapy/getting help i'm 18 and have never gone to therapy or received any help and i really want to try it out but i'm so terrified of it and keep thinking things such as, 'what if i misinterpret a question and answer ""wrong""' or that i will waste their time by not being completely truthful. i very very rarely open up to anyone and when i do i have the sudden urge to cut off all contact with them which would obviously not be very useful with a therapist. i did once apply for therapy for social anxiety but cancelled the process just as i got to the last step because i convinced myself i was faking it. i want help and i don't want things to get worse but i don't know how to go about it.

"Expressing myself I feel like I’ve had a realization in the last few months that I wanted to share. It’s that one of the ways forward with this disability for me is to learn how to honestly express myself without distortion, and to do that constantly without regard for the fact that it causes me pain and discomfort.

 I used to cope with my issues by putting on a mask of a personality that I built using self help books and a desperate need for approval. Basically just the ‘fake it til you make it strategy’. Although I became more conventionally likable, it truly did not help in the long run as I was never able to get close to people. Now I am back to an ultimately isolated life. But I’m trying something different.

It’s very challenging to me and not always doable but I think it is necessary. And that is to view socializing as a simple and honest expression of myself between others. When I have a thought or opinion or feeling, say it, put it out there in some way (for better or worse). Also, treat what others say as true expression of their being. This may sound silly but I think it is a subtle seeming thing that is actually big deal.

As I said it’s challenging and not always doable, this is because 
1. A deeply negative emotional and sometimes physical reaction to the idea of expressing most things in my mind for fear of embarrassment or rejection.
2. My brain going blank due to weariness and therefor not having anything to express.
3. The fact that isolation makes me depressed and lonely so the things on my mind can bring the vibe down.

But regardless I realize that this is what I have to do, and that watching myself mindfully and purely expressing what’s on my mind is the only way forward. Usually what happens when I force something out is that I brace for impact. Brace for embarrassment, rejection, etc. Usually I assume that people are secretly embarrassed for me for whatever I said, but whether or not that is true isn’t important.

I’ve been trying a lot of tools of expression such as music, writing, and drawing, and I think these are helping me learn how to express myself naturally.

Anyway, I’m tired of pretending. Im not sure if I will ever be able to speak without fear and shame, but at least I won’t have to strain myself into a ‘safe’ caricature. Maybe this seems like crazy person thoughts but I hope someone relates or understands.",Personality disorder

"I am frustrated. that is the constant theme with my life. I just turned 30 last month and never really even wanted to make it that far in this state of mediocrity. My stepdad broke me as a person growing up. I am frankly terrified of men, especially loud obnoxious southern men like him who seem to all spout out endless streams of racist hate and blind adherence to tradition. he is the exact definition of the type of person I hate most and I see him in seemingly every man I have to interact with. And as a man, I am expected to be the same. And I am terrified of standing up to them all so I just stay quiet. I am just as much to blame as they are for so much that is wrong in the world because I am so chickenshit I cannot call them out when they are wrong.I spent between the ages of 17-23 absorbed in a religious phase that wasted away any potential I had. I developed a passivity that still lingers to this day, although in a more secular form. I hated my life then and did not want to admit it out of some sense of guilt so I just focused every aspect of my life around anticipating death in hopes of finally getting to reach some illusionary paradise in an afterlife. I did not care about anything. I just wanted ""some job I could tolerate"" to get myself through life until I could finally die. I thought too much and read too much to put it simply and started to question how the world worked. I began to take seriously the possibility that my religion was incorrect and that there might not actually be any meaning, any purpose other than what I defined for myself. I became obsessed with trying to correct my life's trajectory, having wasted away the years I should have been using to achieve education in favor of Christian superstition I had filled my head with. I wanted to be brilliant more than anything. I wanted to try to make up for what I had lost. I tried like hell to get myself straightened out and through school but failed horribly at it. I took on a few jobs trying to pay my way through school and hated every second of them, surrounded constantly by the kind of person my stepdad was. The kind of person I am apparently supposed to be in order to be a good, god-fearing American. I spent another year trying to cling desperately to something I could live for. I got myself out of my mom's house at least so that I was finally away from her own brand of religious nonsense. I successfully got into an actual relationship for the first time in my life and basically just coasted through the next few years. I obviously could not go to school since I had fucked that up. So I just did menial work I hated and coped with life as best as I could. I could not help myself and started seriously studying on my own a couple years ago, right around the beginning of 2018. With no direction or guidance, I basically just gravitated wildly toward any philosophical topic I could find that interested me and began to seriously write in an attempt at parsing my own view of reality and my place in it, as well as where to go from there. This project continued along with my regular visits to therapy and medication that I genuinely believed helped me at the time. My counselor began to suggest I look into trying to return to school again. It was something I was afraid of, but I did start to research it and found that it was possible for me to do it. I went back to school in fall 2019 and loved it. I certainly did not feel any connection to any fellow students, but it gave me regular intellectual challenges and a sense of growth. I was not able to take as many classes in person as I would have liked to because of work, but I tried to make the most of the experience. 2020 everything went to shit for everyone it seemed, and I was no exception. I had started to develop psoriatic arthritis over the past year and this escalated to a point where I lost most of my grip strength and could barely function physically at all. Given that the only things I am qualified to do for pay involve mindlessly moving things around or doing repetitive physical tasks, I felt broken and useless at doing something I hated but had to do no matter what if I wanted to survive. I began to consider suicide for the first time in years and wound up hospitalized. I eventually lost my job in the summer and struggled until I could get some treatment for PsA. When I started infusions I felt immediate relief and regained some sense of utility as a person. I was struggling with balancing classes with the job I was able to get and I jumped around aimlessly between a few jobs. I lost the last job I had in January. I was working at a food bank/thrift store donation center and missed work so I could attend a job interview elsewhere. It was not that I hated the job, I simply hated being there and having to work for a literal church. I hated sitting in employee meetings and hearing everyone ramble about how all the problems were caused by satan and that we needed to remain strong against ""the enemy"" knowing full well that they meant people like me. Useless godless leftist scum who just get in the way. I never got the job I interviewed for and I have been jobless ever since. I lived off savings and unemployment through that time. I lost my patience with school because as always I fail at every endeavor it seems. I felt out of place trying desperately to claw my way into an academic setting I had no business being in as someone from a working class background. I have no patience for formalities, for gatekeeping, or for endless bureaucracy. I cannot fathom suffering through another 6+ years of this to hopefully stand a chance at being valued as someone worth taking seriously when I know statistically that is incredibly unlikely. I do not have contacts, I do not know anyone, I have no shortcuts I can take. I haphazardly withdrew from college in early April citing frustration with my lack of belonging in a field which is more interested in maintaining extant social institutions than upending them. As someone who actively hates society as it is, I have lost nearly all interest in attempting to stabilize it as though we need only vote for the right liberal every four years to make everything better while nothing materially changes and the rest of the world suffers for it. I phrases my withdrawal in a way which understandably appeared to indicate a threat to myself and campus police came and made me go to the ER. Another hospital stay. I have stopped talking to my girlfriend about this stuff. She does not really care or seem to understand anymore and has told me as much at times. She is comfortable with her place in the world where she can rely on the police to handle her problems for her and get rid of those pesky undesirables who make too much noise at night rather than going and having a discussion with them herself. And I am no better. They do not bother me like they seem to bother her, but I cannot shake the fear that the situation will escalate out of control.Anyway I still have no job and I have no desire to return to college, having once again wasted more years of my life. I am tired of going outside every goddamn day and being hounded by people trying to give me religious pamphlets and by my family telling my to pray and everything will get better. I just want someone to take me fucking seriously for once in my life when I beg them to stop shoving religious shit in my face. And I am too fucking cowardly to outright tell them I am an atheist. They cannot even comprehend how such a thing could be possible. It is as though Christianity is some truth embedded in nature itself. I am terrified of finding work again because my work history is terrible and I have become obsessed with the desire to live authentically, which seems impossible to reconcile with the daily process of work. I am an inconvenience on society, which would rather like to just go about their lives praying and patiently waiting for an afterlife they will never get and *insisting* that I and others do the same, going so far as to legislate their preferred world into existence. I just want to get out of everyone is way and be left alone. I am tired of hating their ignorant fucking superstitions to the point where it is exhausting and I just want to die so I can stop bothering them. I am terrified of dying because the only thing I really care about anymore are my two cats. And I do not think my girlfriend would be able to keep them since her family is allergic and I cannot stand the thought of them suffering but I cannot stand the thought of suffering myself. I am a bitter asshole and I just want to see the world look like it might someday be a tolerable place to live in, but we are just going to cook ourselves to death slowly while making a quick buck along the way. I cannot write for shit anymore. My mind is everywhere. I do not know how the fuck I can work like this and I do not even want to at all. I do not do anything but sit around playing video games these days because they give me some semblance of control over *something*. I run a D&amp;D campaign every week. And I have my cats. These are small things but they are all I have anymore. I do not think humanity is ever going to unfuck itself and I do not want to sit around watching it get worse. But I simultaneously do not want to let go of these brief, tiny pleasures. I am trying to figure out a way to just stay out of everyone is way so I can at least live out my cats' lives.

"Vraylar/Reagila.. restlessness, any tips? I started Reagila a month ago and I can't get rid of the restlessness. The first two weeks were horror with side effects, thank God the shaking stopped.

Funny how people can say that it gets better when everything is pointless and even the moments of joy in life are fleeting. How can someone say it gets better with such certainty when there is never truly any end to the meaninglessness of this existence? Nobody is going to drop from the sky and say here is your purpose along with the means to fulfill it. What is their definition of better? One singular good day? Maybe a year of being moderately content with life? Until it goes to shit again as it inevitably always does? Feels like we are all slaves to our own consciousness.

"feeling down trigger warning: talks about grief and mourning

Hi everyone! I thought I'd check in though I haven't been all that active in this community recently. By all accounts I'm doing pretty well- I'm successful in my job and have settled into the city I've moved to for about a year. Starting to form some social connections and am in therapy. It's been 1 year since my last hospital visit and my symptoms are really going down. I also started following one of my passions and started writing a book about my mental health experiences.

what I want to chat about is how you all keep it together when life throws you some shitty stuff? My grandma passed away recently, and my family is still dealing with stuff about her passing. We were very close and I hadn't seen her in about a year since I live on the other side of the country. I ended up not going to the funeral but shared some memories that my family read. I won't get into details here but we may also sell one of her properties that was very meaningful to me growing up. Her passing also caused some tension in our family, which I'm not personally involved in but still feels stressful.

Then, totally out of the blue, another person I didn't know well but who worked with me also passed away. I can't help feeling regret about not talking to this person more, and wish that I had spent more time to do that. Actually, I'm feeling that about my grandma as well. Looking for any suggestions about how to keep it positive when you're dealing with tough stuff like this? I feel a lot of regret and sadness about not spending more time with these people. I also feel a little bit of disillusionment and a little hopeless just generally thinking about how our time on earth is limited. It's also wintertime, so I think that's contributing too. Has anyone been dealing with anything similar, or gotten through something like this?",Bipolar

I’m taking some over the counter meds and trying to tell myself I can wait this out until my appointment on Monday. I’m not in any pain anymore but my face is swollen still.

Anyway I know a tooth infection left untreated can get worse and start breaking down your jaw and infect your heart and whatnot and the thought of that is really freaking me out.

"Bipolar Disorder rarely shows up alone: some interesting co-morbidity statistics I recently spoke to my psychiatrist about my bipolar disorder improving with treatment, but not my other mental health issues. I let him know how embarrassed I was about the ordeal, because I sometimes feel ashamed about the number of issues I have. He shared with me some statistics that reassured me quite a bit and made me realize I'm not alone. This info helped me find more self acceptance, and I thought it might help some of you as well.  
  
These statistics come from a public 2008 psychiatry study (n=9282). I'll post the full link below, as well as the specific chart I'm getting these figures from in case you'd rather dig in yourself. Here's some of the statistics that stood out to me: 
  
 * **92%** of people with BD will be deal with another mental disorder 
  
* **70%** of people with BD will deal with with 3 or more other mental disorders 
   
  * **75%** of people with BD will be deal an anxiety disorder 
  
* **63%** of people with BD will deal with an impulse control disorder 
  
* **42%** of people with BD will deal with a substance abuse disorder

"Frustrating set back with HA Looking for some support right now! My health anxiety started in the midst of some real health concerns. I was eventually diagnosed with a tumor in my pituitary and am currently taking medication to deal with that. Even so I developed severe HA, concentrated around having a heart condition. 

I ended up in the hospital once and in urgent care half a dozen times over the course of 6 months. I also went to see my GP several times during this period. Every time an EKG was done and it came out normal. At the urging of GP I went to see a psychiatrist and therapist. 

I’ve been on Zoloft for about 8 weeks now. The beginning was rough but lately I’ve felt great. One of my biggest triggers has been my blood pressure, and it’s been weeks since I checked it. I was checking my BP just about every 10 minutes before. I was also afraid to exert myself, but have been able to start exercising again, which feels great. 

Last night things went off the rails. My usual symptoms- pain in my upper left chest, arm pain/numbness, and crushing fear all returned. I checked my BP several times and was only able to fall asleep when I collapsed from exhaustion. I took a klonopin, which I have so I can deal with panic attacks like last night. 

Today I’ve been feeling anxious the entire day, I’ve resisted taking klonopin again because I don’t want to become dependent on it. I feel incredibly frustrated. I have come such a long way in the last few weeks and I’m afraid I’m falling back into my old ways. 

I’m going back to my psych on Friday but I’m scared of spending the week in a near constant panic. Has anyone else experienced something similar? How did you deal with it and do you have any advice that can help? Having HA is like living in your own personal hell and I really don’t feel like I can go back to what my life was like before.

"Apologies in advance if this post does not totally make sense, I am feeling emotional and I am also a bit high...I have been feeling extra suicidal for the past couple weeks, have a history of attempts, and I think sometimes when the suicidal feelings are this strong they stay strong until I 'do' something about them, i.e. try to off myself. And today I have been seriously considering doing it again, and am honestly trying to talk myself into it because the logistics are right (dog would be taken care of) and I had a therapy session today that basically seemed to confirm for me that things are hopeless and are not going to change any time soon. But, ambivalence.So...my dilemma is that if I am rational enough to think that I should maybe take myself to the psychiatric hospital ER, then presumably that is me deciding not to kill myself, so then why am I even at the ER? But if I do not take myself there, it is like suicide is still on the table and it is a 'should I or should not I' kind of torture until the point when these feelings get a little less strong (which is not necessarily any time soon, based on recent history) or I am upset enough to stop thinking rationally and try something impulsive. And I know I would just fail again. And I cannot deal with more of that flavour of shame.I know asking for advice on the internet for a topic like this is not ideal, so I am not asking whether you think I should go to the hospital or not, but maybe share what you have done if you have found yourself in a similar situation? I usually do not find helplines helpful and it is been a while since I went to ER and I am just not sure if this is one of those times when it makes sense to go. I do not want to feel like a moron telling them I am there because I do not want to kill myself, and be stuck there for hours when it is not like they are going to be able to help improve anything short term. I already see a psychiatrist every other week so it is not like I need them to connect me with that resource.

"The hollow self My life is spent largely devoted to work. Between morning prep, commute, actual work hours, and evening prep like laundry, packing lunches, and other small maintenance tasks I only get about 3 hours a day to be myself. After all, I need to be in bed at a decent hour or else I won’t be well-rested for the next work day. That’s it. That’s my life.

Meanwhile, even though I’m so devoted to work that I sacrifice the vast majority of my life for it, I’m barely earning enough money to survive. I have over $50,000 in debt that is slowly growing as I struggle to make ends meet. I don’t know if I can ever pay it off. I can pay off maybe 1/3rd of it if I really push hard and eat ramen for the next 6 months. I’m turning 40 in 6 months.

At what point am I supposed to go from “surviving” to “thriving”? I know most people earn the majority of their money later in life but I just don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel. What is my purpose? Why am I grinding on the world’s worst-ever RPG system? I feel like I’m on an economic treadmill that keeps speeding up every year, and at some point I know I won’t be able to keep up.

My job itself is relatively easy, I’m a data analyst at a medical device manufacturer. For the most part it’s just pulling reports for managers and being really good at Excel and Power BI. Though I don’t know if I’m that good at my job. Tomorrow marks 1 year in this position, and every night I feel like I’m doing the bare minimum. Like I’m that guy on the team that everyone else talks about behind his back. I imagine they say things like, “He’s so slow. What’s he even doing all day?” or “I better schedule this meeting because if I wait for him to do it, it’ll never get done.” They don’t say these things out loud of course, and maybe they don’t even think them… but maybe they do. Maybe I’m just treading water but refusing to swim towards the shore. I think I’m ok because my head is still above water, but realistically if I keep doing this I will drown. I need to swim.

I just feel like such a loser, all the time. I don’t have kids, and I don’t want them. I’m not married, but I’ve been in a relationship with someone for just over 12 years. We live together. She makes a lot more than I do, so she pays the mortgage and I pay everything else. It’s probably not a fair arrangement for her, but I just literally don’t make enough to split everything 50/50. She earns $40k more than I do a year. She would literally need to pay our mortgage 3x a month just to get to my wage. Then we could split the 4th one, that would make it even. Even with that justification in my mind, it makes me feel like a loser. Not that she makes more than me- good for her! She deserves it! Just that I can’t contribute equally. I feel like a mooch. We work the same hours at the same company and do roughly the same amount of work. But her’s pays more. Them’s the breaks I guess.

Overwhelming shame. About nearly everything.

I’m too fat. I’m too bald. I’m too old.

I’m not smart enough. I’m not rich enough. I’m not funny enough.

I know those are called “automatic negative thoughts”, or ANTs, and like ants they should be easy to squash. I’ve read about them in cognitive behavioral therapy books. I would go to therapy, but it’s expensive. My company pays for 3 sessions a year. The other 49 weeks you can fuck off and die, I guess.

Is there more to this life? Is this all I’m supposed to do? Click buttons all fucking day, sit on the couch and scroll on my phone while watching some insipid movie or tv show, then repeat? All day, every day, until I’m old enough to scrape by on social security? This is it, huh? This is the whole fucking thing?

There needs to be more, because I swear sometimes it just doesn’t feel worth it. I’m not suicidal or anything but like what exactly is motivating me to keep going?

I have hobbies and interests, and I indulge in them as often as I can. I grow hot peppers and make my own hot sauces, I hike in the woods and enjoy nature, there’s so many things to occupy my free time—if I HAD ANY- but the fact is I devote 87.5% of my day to making someone else richer. So my measly 3 hours a day- which are in the darkness by the way because the sun has set- are not exactly prime times for gardening or hiking. I have an automatic timer that waters my plants for me because I can’t even be present to tend to my own garden.

It’s absolutely ridiculous.

When exactly am I supposed to do anything of substance, of value?

3 hours in the fucking dark.

That’s what I get to live off of.

Most of that time is spent focusing on my increasing mound of debt.

$50,000 would literally change my life and put me back in the green for the first time in years. Meanwhile, I get to help analyze the company private jet spend. Cost us over $365,000 to operate for a total of 11 days last month. We paid $75,000 just in pilot fees for the month of January. I don’t earn that in a year. So when I see how much money there is, how much is available to toss around, and just how little of it I get… why would I “work harder”? Why would I sign up for more of this disrespect?

I just don’t know why. Why can’t I work 4 days instead of 5? Why can’t I be remote, considering I have only had 1 face-to-face meeting in the last month? I’m wasting a ton of money on a car that I primarily use to get to work, a ton of money on a special wardrobe that I only wear at work—it’s absurd. And depressing.",Personality disorder

People do not really care about me, and mainly it is because I do not fit well in the group, and its dynamic. they are just not my kind of people, but I act mostly happy, and I do almost whatever people ask me to do, because that is what good colleagues do, right?But last Sunday we had a talk after work with a couple of beers (I work in a restaurant, so there is booze around), and one of them suggested the girls would rank the boys on looks, and on character, and the boys did do too vice versa. Anyways, I ended dead last of the men on the whole spectrum, and it made me feel uncomfortable. I mean, the question to begin with was cringe-worthy to begin with.Anyways, there is more going on with my life that does not fit well in my life, but I like to keep that private, if you do not mind.Anyways, but how do you hide your depression for others? Are you a great ""actor"", or does it show? What are your tactics/moves/tips?I am not willing to go with antidepressants, because I am going to, it takes your soul away. No offense.I am glad to say I have the best girlfriend I can imagine, and I got great friends, so there is that. But at work it just is not that great (plus the other personal shit I am going through).I am just curious in how you cope with feeling really down, or downright depressed, and how you are successfully showing it to the world like there is nothing going on.I hope I did not annoyed, or insulted, any of you with this question and message. If you are depressed, how well can you hide it from the outside world?",Depression

"Anyone ever experienced this on Latuda? I've been taking Latuda for about two weeks now, first week at 40 then upped to 60. 40 seemed okay but 60 made me throw up the meds so my psych changed me to 20mg in the morning and 40 mg in the evening. 

I feel absolutely horrible. After taking the meds I feel this excrutiating restlessness like a constant surge of electricity running through my brain. Nothing helps. I can't  focus on anything. It's so bad that when I feel it coming on I take antihistamines to slow my brain down and sleep it off. It's left me writing on my bed before trying to get it to go away.

"Spinning Downhill All Over Again, PLEASE HELP! I haven't been to this sub in over a year. I started stressing about the things I was reading, and freaking out more, even though I just wanted to support others like they were giving me. I decided to stop googling, stop this sub and try to re focus, to feel some relief from the anxiety.

 2018 has started out pretty rough, issues with relationship, stress and more stress have been a real struggle. Therapy hasn't been feeling the same neither does school which last year I was so happy to actually be doing. It's a sad time.

Between all this I've tried different things to help me, yoga, some gym, journaling, hobbies etc. I realize that my life will forever be good and bad days....TODAY IS A BAD DAY! I'm overwhelmed and I'm not even out of bed yet.

I feel asleep fine last night (thankfully) and sleep through most of the night (again, thankfully) however I woke up at 530 to my right thigh twitching so quickly and non stop. Maybe I needed a stretch? No...Still going. 

It doesn't hurt but I've regrettable done something bad. I've let myself have bad thoughts, then fueled them with the dreaded Google...PLEASE HELP.

1. I saw where it could be just benign twitching...COULD BE. Last year I went to the gym and may have lifted  wrong so the next day I had arm twitching almost all day. But for this case I haven't been to the gym since Monday! (Now Wednesday). Can't be that...right?

2. Stress can cause an overload of muscle stuff...even if I sleep? I'm dissecting everything right now. Yes it's been a hard month with you health fears and questions and stress but I'm now like thinking to myself I'm not really that stressed can that truly be the cause?

3. Google sucks, it's the worst type of fear enabler, yet so accessible. I'm finding so much, Lou Gherigs disease??? Ahh!!! I can see the twitch so that's promising but I'm finding it hard to no look up other symptoms...is it possible???

4. Heart issues! I've always been focused on cancer and stuff along those lines but now I'm freak g about heart stuff. My fit bit typically sometimes shows a range of 58-119+bpm depending on exercise, and relaxation etc. 
I didn't sleep with it last night, but as soon as I saw the heart stuff on Google that heart arythmia and skipping beats I ran to put it on. It ran 54 bpm... then at 66  down to 61 bpm (granted back In bed in my safe zone) but what if my heart is beating too low??? It's slowly shutting off and gave me the leg twitch as a signal?!?!

"Been Diagnosed for about three months now and had a few questions... Hi, I had a recent diagnosis of Bipolar/Manic Depressive disorder after an episode of psychosis in the summer time.

I am just a little confused on my diagnosis. You see I've been super depressed for a really long time and aside from last year (I became manic and then had psychosis) I haven't really had any up/high feelings of mood aside from again the one last year. My Psychiatrist said he's 75% certain that I have bipolar so I'll take his word for it but I'm just a little confused.

So I guess my questions are;

- Is it common to have the majority of your mood with bipolar be depression?

- Is it common to have long periods of depression with bipolar and short infrequent bouts of mania?

- When is it common to start exhibiting signs that your bipolar when you haven't been diagnosed at a young age?

Sorry if the questions are kind of stupid, I just want to start some conversations about my new found mental illness and learn some things. Thanks friends.",Bipolar

**My heart is completely healthy. No blockages and no damage to it whatsoever.** 

This is one of my happier days!!! 

They told me the chest pain -- which I can reproduce by touching it -- is likely caused by either anxiety or costochondritis and the heavy tightness is likely anemia (which I can deal with much better than heart disease). The left arm pain is probably from inflammation because I lay on it so awkwardly and for too long at night. 

I'm OK :') 

Anxiety is a bitch, guys. It can make you truly believe and FEEL the most frustrating and uncomfortable symptoms. I'm not saying to dismiss everything as anxiety -- it will always be better to see a doctor -- but what I am saying is none of you are alone.

4. Never take any responsibility, always contort discussions, criticisms, and play victim.

Also seems she’s used to using and disregarding partners/men. Her life long friend called her out on this.

"Seeing some progress but feeling stuck. Hi,

24-year-old male with AVPD here. For some time I have noticed that contacts with other people (in my case only at work) began to bring me pleasure. I've also become more relaxed and when I'm around people I don't worry as much about how they react to what I say. At the same time, a desire for more close relationhips arosed in me. This desire applies both to finding a partner and friends. I just want, as real as never before in my life, a simple conversation with another person and intimacy.

However, I don't know how to achieve this. I've finished my education and I don't have any social hobbies (the gym can be considered as such, but I still can't find a way to start naturally a conversation with other people there). I'm starting to get annoyed with this situation, because certainly something has changed in my attiude and I truly want to form some relationships outside of my work environment. I think I'm ready to get out of my comfort zone step by step, but I don't know how to do it.

One way to do it is to start dating. Finding a partner is something that I want very strongly and I think love is something I'm capable of. The thing that's holding me back from making that move though (other than, well... the lack of photos to use on dating apps) is knowing that I'll be too much of a burden for her not having other relationships. Perhaps there is also an element of shame in not having any friends. I am not sure…

Have any of you reached such a point on your journey to ""normality""? I'm not sure if I'm over-analyzing everything and if I shouldn't just do what I feel regardless of my doubts.

"How bad does it have to be to be considered psychosis? I know I've had at least one episode of what was probably psychosis because I was diagnosed with stress induced psychosis when it was happening. I don't know if that one was bipolar related or not, and I wasn't treated with anything at the time because I was still quite young and the psychiatrist didn't want to intervene with medication.

However, I've had other symptoms since during what were probably undiagnosed manic or mixed episodes where I've started to believe things that were, retrospectively, pretty weird. Occasionally these beliefs also pop up when I'm very, very depressed. Sometimes I believe these things 100% unquestioningly, and other times I know they don't make sense but worry about them excessively anyway. Sometimes it fluctuates between the two.

A common one for me is worrying that other people can hear my thoughts, especially if I look at them directly. I also get concerns about people working against me or talking about me behind my back to try to ruin my life.

Another time I became convinced my childhood home was haunted and that a demon had followed me from there into my daily life. I kept seeing a figure in my room at night and I worried about speaking about him out loud in case he came for me. I still worry about this sometimes, and tbf I'm pretty sure that house really was haunted. My childhood friends and I talk about the weird slightly paranormal stuff that happened there so I'm not alone with that, but my sudden obsession with it was abnormal.

I told a different psychiatrist about those two a while back and he said it was probably due to a combination of autism and trauma, and that it would likely go away with more EMDR. Since they kind of just left as my mood changed, he was satisfied that his therapy had worked.

I had another one where I decided I was actually naturally nocturnal and that other people were interfering with that to purposefully make me sick and stop my plans. I completely flipped my sleep schedule for several weeks (although admittedly I wasn't sleeping very much anyway), and then fought with all my family and friends about it.

At one point I also became very worried that other dog walkers were all talking about me on Facebook and were plotting to take my dog away. 

Another time I was certain I was dying of some horrible illness and all the medical professionals I saw weren't treating me on purpose because they wanted me to die. (I really was sick though, but the level of paranoia was weird).

I was still somewhat functional while all of these were happening, and I wasn't hearing voices or anything for the most part. So does it really count as anything serious? Because it didn't seem that bad to me, and my family just kind of ignored it since they'd been told that the episodes were stress related and it was best not to engage. I've never told a psychiatrist about all of the thoughts because I didn't view them as relevant; until recently, I just thought they were a part of life and it was something I did when I got stressed.

TLDR; at what point does it cross the line into actual psychosis vs ""being paranoid and having weird thoughts""?

I'm going to be starting medication for the first time soon if all goes well. My current psychiatrist is talking about putting me on antipsychotics, but idk if these episodes are really bad enough to warrant taking an antipsychotic. I've been reading about the drugs and they sound like heavy duty stuff, and I can't tell if, for me, it's really necessary. I think I'd rather try another type of mood stabilising medication first.

"Scared of Klinefelters I seem to have alot of the symptoms for it, low confidence, Insecure and anxious and emotional, I didn't fit in and I admittedly have some feminine behaviors and I can't grow that much hair.

As a kid I was described as somewhat masculine, never picked up girl toys and etc but I guess that doesn't really matter.

i just think from what i know about social anxiety is that well its obviously anxiety related so it deals more with anxious thoughts surrounding social activities. avpd to me is more so the innate feelings that you are inept and that there is something deeply wrong with you to the core and thats why nobody likes you therefore you stay alone. i just think they're separate things because not everyone with social anxiety experiences that. let me know what you guys think!",Personality disorder

I literally felt her lose interest in talking to me as I said that.

This was only my second time meeting her and we never delved into any of the main issues that I was facing but she brushed me off so quickly all because I wasn't sobbing my eyes out or felf like committing suicide.

"AvPD doesn’t mean that your brain is ill right? I was thinking that AvPD isn’t caused by some brain illness. It is very possible that most people with AvPD have healthy brain right?

I feel like AvPD is just that we learned things incorrectly, we were exposed to some very stressful situations as child and our brains learned that that situation this is bad.

And now our functioning brain is reminding us with anxiety that this situation is familiar from past when we were learning things. And this anxiety is causing us to avoid these situations because we were learnt that they are bad.

So from this point we can say that our brain is normally functioning? Brain is doing what it is supposed to be doing, trying to stay out of danger and survive.",Personality disorder
"Recovering from psychosis I recently had a bad manic episode which very quickly descended into bad psychosis. I’m thankfully coming out of it now and am under the care of the crisis team and getting daily home visits. 

However what I’m really struggling with is processing what’s happened to me. I have all these memories of the delusions I was having and how strongly I believed in them, and while I know now that they weren’t real (mostly, I still have flashes of confusion) I’m feeling really rocked by what’s happened. I can’t get over how quickly I lost my grip on reality and how dangerous it was. 

I know it’s normal to feel depressed after something like this, but I guess all I’m looking for is reassurance that I’m not alone with this, and that other people have gone through psychosis and come out the other side. 

Any anecdotes or words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated. Particularly around what recovery was like and how long it took. Thank you.",Bipolar

"Where did my AvPD come from? So I am officially diagnosed with it but most people on the internet and also my therapist say that it is likely because of a childhood of abusive/narcissistic or in any other way bad parents that resulted in this condition. But I don’t think that it comes from that. I couldn’t have had better parents or family; they supported me, respected my opinion and so on. I have the feeling that I always was like that even in kindergarten back then. The only thing odd about my parents was that they divorced as I was 6 years old (but I guess that’s not the most uncommon thing) and that my father is also very socially avoidant. Could it also be the latter (like in a „learned“ behavior?) or do you think it is more likely that it was something in the past that I just forgot and don’t remember / don’t think is significant enough?

"Generalizing people is ruining me and I don't know how to fix it Just a quick example of what I mean:

Sometimes you're just talking to a person, and you're getting along  great, and you're just in that moment and you're enjoying it in its isolation, and you think ""Wow you now what, maybe things are fine"", and that person says something that just snaps you right back. It's not necessarily political, but one example was a classmate I'm getting along fine with who is a woman but is heavily against feminism, and once a month goes on a rant about it and it makes me just so exhausted and disinterested in pursuing that friendship. The other is my brother who's like ""Oh I'm fine with gay people"" but then yesterday 'joked' about how ""only the women that look like men are real lesbians, I see the 'normal' looking women in lesbian relationships as just experimenting"" 

It's so fucking exhausting and isolating. And I live in a fucking racist homophobic shithole of a country to begin with, and any time I meet at least somewhat of an openminded person they still have that one thread of fascism they refuse to let go of.

And god it's fucking hard not to see this whole country as a country of neo nazis. No matter how much I try to focus on the positives, all I ever see is people in Pro-Russian protest or people attacking alternative bars or spraying neonazi symbols on city walls. 

It's endlessly fucking depressing. And any time I complain about it to people they all say ""Oh don't look at it like that. Not everybody acts or thinks the way they think"". But it's so hard not to. It feels dishonest and fake not to. 

And I already have trobules with being social and opening up to people and now there's always this layer of ""Oh well I gotta be cautious with what I say about what I think because any person could hold back some fascistic views"" . With men especially. The men here are a whole different kind of intolerant pigs.

It's so bad that I'm constantly undervaluing my own opinions and thoughts. It fucking sucks. I never verbalize what I think or feel, because this whole culture is built on constant arguments and belittlings and wanting to prove yourself right that it gets so exhausting to socialize. 

And I want to socialize. I desperataely want a friendgroup, and a circle of people I'm comfortable with because I have none of that right now, and it sucks because I can't even break out of that caution to even begin to start looking for people. And it's so hard not to filter people through an Ideological Filter because that's always what it boils down to.

Also, I have already lost interest with literally anything in life so I really do not know what I want to do in the future. I am dreading to retake the class I failed I would rather die than solve another word problem.I thought of how I came to be in this situation, and it boils downs to me being just not ready with college in the first place. I had a major accident during my senior year in high school (2017) and I really thought that would be it for me. My mental health just went down hill from there, if I analysed my thoughts correctly.I tried talking with a counselor freshman year in 2019 but I just cannot convey my thoughts properly. She was nice and all but I felt misunderstood all throughout and ended up ghosting her. Now, I am thinking if I should try talking to someone again. I just do not want to be officially diagnosed with anything (tho I feel like I am depressed and bipolar) because I feel like I will end up going to comparing myself with the ""normal"" people on why I am like this.

"Pet Peeve: When people think I owe them conversation triggers my AvPD bad. Does anyone else get annoyed when either family or strangers get an attitude with you if you don't entertain their conversation? I can be civil and nice IRL. I'm not walking around telling people eff you, eff this, eff that. However, the WORST ones are the people that think they are giving me golden advice like ""hey, don't do drugs"" but they have never known me to do such things. It's painting me in a bad light for me to agree with the advice willy nilly. But the kicker is: they get upset if I escalate and say I don't do drugs to begin with? Do I look like a crack head to them? 

They take it as me being **immature** and unable to take advice. So I am supposed to sit here and entertain disrespectful conversation with people giving me advice on not to be irresponsible and that's what makes someone mature?  This has happened with strangers too where they think they can talk to me about avoiding marriage cause theirs suck or dating because of their own griefs. Whether I get married or whatever I do is not their business. 

I usually only get approached with stupid conversations like that by family. They get big mad when I shut it down. The only carrot they dangle over my head is money.

I used to be a math / computer science major at a top 3 US university doing well (3.9 GPA), and since the episode have been struggling cognitively.

"Just venting Wanna preface this by saying that I'm not diagnosed nor do I self-diagnose. It's just that I can relate to some of the symptoms and people here, and I'm wondering if anyone can relate to my feelings.

I feel insane sometimes. I feel really neurotic, paranoid, insecure, and immature sometimes. When I don't think about memories or people that upset me, I'm fine. These past few months I've been slowly recovering from this horrible depression that's plagued me for a while, but in these past few days it's been returning as I start thinking about these bad memories again.

I feel traumatized and like I'm a victim of something I can't understand. Like I'm alone in this pain. The thing is that my ""trauma"" is really just a dozen or so bad interactions I had in my old circle of friends. In particular, there was this one person who I had a handful of unpleasant interactions with. These were mostly brief exchanges that shouldn't have affected me as much as they did, but they felt really, sincerely resentful and unwarranted. What did I do? I didn't know how to stand up for myself, and nobody did for me.

This person lashed out at me, calling me insecure and afraid a couple of times, and said some horrible things about people with my disability. They're ableist and, honestly, that group as a whole was too. Not out of malicious intent but ignorance.

This person wasn't wrong, but the way they treated me didn't help. Seeing those criticisms mirrored by others a couple of times made me feel even more weak, because I knew I was being talked about behind my back. And when I did eventually see how this person talked about me behind my back, it felt nasty and unwarranted.

Still though, it feels so fucking stupid man. I don't know why I let this hurt me. It's been months since I stopped talking to those friends, a few years since those bad exchanges occured, and it still affects me. I never met a person who exhibited such resentment for me in my life, seemingly for no justifiable reason. It really hurt my self-esteem and it still does.

When I think about those friends for too long I start to say things like ""I wanna die"" to myself, like a tic. It's so stupid and I feel like a horrible person for this. For feeling such disproportionate hurt over a dozen or so bad memories. When I don't think about this stuff I begin to feel more ""normal"" again though.

Sorry that this is so long but I'm just wondering if anyone can relate. If not, sorry for wasting your time. I hope this isn't considered off-topic since I'm undiagnosed. But yeah, I feel really pathetic about this side of myself. Maybe I'm just highly neurotic, I don't know. I just wish I could understand what's wrong with me.",Personality disorder

i cant tell if its avoidant personality disorder or body dysmorphia or a sick combination of both but i highly suspect i suffer from avpd. it just all makes so much fucking sense, too much honestly and it hurts to think that life will always be this painful. i feel like theres nothing i can do about it. ive always said i feel like an alien. that i feel like i experience being a human differently than everyone else is. because if everyone else was hurting as much as me, no way theyd be able to keep it to themselves. everyone would be crying all the time. and theyre not. so i must be the weird one. 

i have these online friends i wanna meet, known them for 11 years, and they only live a few hours away. theyve expressed interest several times and im just this freak who cant leave the house. the thought of them looking at me terrifies me. theyve seen me through a phone screen but what if in person im too ugly? realistically i know they wouldnt suddenly turn on me and start bullying or anything but the idea that the thought still might pop into their heads, something along the lines of “oh, disappointing” or “at least i dont look like that” … its too much. its painful to think about. 

theres one friend who is pretty special to me. we met as kids through an online game, had a little flirty/crush/puppy love thing going on for a while but we grew up and didnt stay as close through the years, just checking in here or there… but lately they have become one of the most important people ever to me. and those dumb childish feelings started coming back, only now i think its evolved into something more, and i seriously have been hopelessly pining after them for the past 3 years or so… 

recently, they said they liked me. took me COMPLETELY by surprise as i had been trying (and failing miserably) to get over them. so this should be great news. but nothing can happen now. we just expressed our mutual “like” and now we flirt a little here and there but they said they dont think they can be in a romantic relationship right now, yet they keep initiating all of the flirting, and they mentioned how its hard not seeing me because if we could hang out things would be easier. which makes a lot of fucking sense. but this is also all very confusing. 

im stuck. im terrified. im ugly… theyve seen my face and know that im fat but theyve never really SEEN me. not fully. not from every angle. not up close. not in person. im anticipating the rejection, the disgust, and its too much… i wanna hold onto this idea in my head of us living happily ever after. and changing the relationship… will probably end in disaster. they said they need my friendship and that theyre scared this could ruin things. im scared too. im scared they’ll see me and any feelings of “like” will fade completely. and if i tell them this, im scared it will only speed up the process. they talk about wanting to kiss me and things like that and… ive never done anything with anyone. 12 yr old me is freaking out, i always hoped they would be my first back then lmao… so many firsts i wanna have and im scared it will mean too much to me and not them. how do i express this? do i even try? how the FUCK do i get over this and go see them? i need to see them. i need them. i need i need i need … i need help. can anyone talk to me?",Personality disorder

i am not sure if this is the right place for it but last friday one of my classmate told me jokingly to jump out of a window i ve had it up to here so i said i d blow my head off my other teacher know i don t mean it most of the time but we had a new teacher during that lesson and i guess he took it seriously will come back to that later on the weekend i tried to hurt myself and went to the hospital on monday they prescribed me some lexapro and i went home relieved that i finally got some help half an hour after i returned home cop stormed my apartment saying they received a hint from the school that i wa gon na hurt myself and they searched my whole apartment for a gun which i don t have so they obv didn t find one they then took me to the same hospital i wa at just half an hour ago and i spoke to the psychiatrist there again who told the police i am not a threat to myself or someone else so they let me go again during that they took my phone and it ran out of battery and i didn t have access to it for like hour or more during that time two of my classmate messaged me asking why i blocked them and they attacked me not knowing my phone ran out of battery and that s why i didn t answer they then blocked me and i explained to them on instagram what happened and they read it but didn t care apparently the police said they would send a car to the school to talk to the headmaster but idk what came out of it i am guessing my new teacher reported it i am so scared of getting kicked out of school god damn i have an exam today and now i am unsure if i am allowed to go to school again today i am currently on my way to find out and i am on the verge of a panic attack because even if i am allowed my classmate will hate me and attack me and it will be super awkward idk what i tried to do with this post but i just needed to tell someone i am so anxious and hate myself for not shutting up for once thanks for reading,Depression
"we're all a work in progress One of the most satisfying things about being a therapist is watching clients build their lives on their terms by applying the content and capabilities they're learning and developing.

"Has ""tough love"" ever worked on any of you? My family is a very ""tough love"" type of family. As far back as I can remember, my parents and sister have tried to get me to change my bad ways/habits through ""tough love"", but all the problems they would try to use it for are still with me, so it clearly has never worked. Just as an example of what I mean, my dad would give me ""tough love"" in the form of telling me no one would ever want to be my friend or hire me if I continued to be a fat slob (true). And the other week my sister came over to the apartment and told me that I wasn't being cute or quirky by almost never cleaning, I'm an adult and need to start acting like one, it is extremely embarrassing at this point, etc (also true). But even though I know these things are true, hearing people phrase it like ""hard truths"" I'm just too dense to grasp doesn't make me want to change for the better. It makes me want to go home, put a gun in my mouth, and pull the trigger because to my family I come off as such a complete moron that they need to tell me obvious shit I already know.

I am wondering if this type of ""tough love"" is actually helpful for anyone, especially people with avpd, because in my experience hearing people judge me like that just drives me to start spiraling down. It's like it really does solidify the fact that I am so worthless compared to actual human beings that they always have to talk down to me, and my relationship with others always has to be me getting scolded even well into my adult years. But everyone keeps touting ""tough love"" as if it's some magic cure-all that will make someone instantly snap out of whatever undesireable thing they're doing.",Personality disorder

&amp;#x200B;

So, I've been on Lamictal for about 8 months and haven't had any issues. I've had it slowly raised from 50mg to 300 mg last week. Since I've raised from 250 mg to 300mg I'm seeing a massive increase in being disoriented, vision being fuzzy, unable to think straight (like type at work or write), and last night I experienced a large amount of paranoia I haven't felt since before I went on the medication. Does this sound like 300 mg might be too much for me and I should go back down to 250 mg?

"Just need to vent Sorry this post is a huge mess. I just need to let everything out and I don't know who to go to right now who would understand my situation. 

So I'm 17 (got diagnosed on my birthday, quick fun fact I guess lol) and moved out of my parent's into an entirely different state back in January. I was doing completely fine, and actually felt on top of the world for awhile. I did some exams that allowed me to graduate early before moving, told myself and everyone I'll get a new job and start college as soon as I can. I haven't been able to get a job here yet, so I have been doing commissions to hold me off for a while. I was doing really good with that, making about $80-200 a week which held me off pretty well (I'm living with my boyfriend who lives with his mom so I don't have to pay rent or anything, just need to buy stuff for myself and my cat) everything was going good. 

I had to stop my meds after I moved because my psychiatrist isn't licensed in this state plus the side effects for the meds I was currently on gave me really bad tardive dyskinesia. My boyfriend's mom has been pressuring me more and more recently to get a job, sending me links for places to apply to more, and I've been applying to them. The other night I had a conversation with my parents (I'm still on good terms with them) and my mom noticed I must be manic because I told her I've been unable to get much sleep at all due to my mind constantly racing. She said she wants me to come visit home asap because she has bipolar too and based on her experience she doesn't want me being unmedicated and manic in an entirely different state especially when the depression comes. 

I told my boyfriend's mom this and she was really disappointed, saying that she doesn't want me to constantly visit back and forth again (before I moved I would visit for a couple weeks very often) and that I'm supposed to have a job by now, and that basically if I'm going to be doing this I should just move back until Im 18. I seriously don't want to move back though. I love my parents and everything and I want to just visit, not move back entirely. I'm happier here with my boyfriend, finally have myself settled and comfortable here, and I'm worried if I move back I'll get addicted to bad habits again because my mental health was a lot worse there. 

My parents and my boyfriend's mom had a whole dispute and I was in the middle of it, and since then I just feel like it triggered something in me and now I feel miserable and sick and scared. I'm sleeping constantly, and when I wake up I have messages from my boyfriend's mom telling me to apply to some place, along with messages from my parents asking when I'll be visiting. I don't want to disappoint or upset either of them with what I do and I don't know what'll be best for me, staying here and getting a job or risking it and going back to get my mental health worked on. I haven't been able to draw much at all since then and I fell behind on my commissions which is making me feel worse and I just don't know what to do right now. I feel stuck and I just want to cry and sleep and ignore all these issues. I haven't felt this shitty in so long, I can't bring myself to do anything and I keep suddenly crying several times a day when I'm awake.

Sorry if this issue seems trivial or anything. I just have an extreme fear of disappointing people which makes this all so much worse for me. I really want to visit my parents and get on something that'll help me, but I'm worried that if I go my boyfriend's mom won't allow me to come back, and I don't want to upset her with my decision since she keeps telling me to apply to the places she's sending me and I'm telling her I will so she won't get upset.

I don't know what I want from this post. I just know I needed to let this all out. If anyone reads this all then personal input or advice is welcome. I'm not sure what to do right now, I need to make a decision quick but I can't bring myself to",Bipolar
"Feel like a leech Sometimes a song stops me in my tracks and [this is one of them](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WjxIuZVgjp8).

My mother would tell me I’m exactly the same type of person as the lyrics of this song describe. She called me a sociopath, someone really sick in the head and not redeemable. That I tried to purposely ruin my family’s lives. Like I had a secret agenda that even I couldn’t know about. It’s been the foundation of all of my relationships with others, and helps explain why I get so nervous trying to get close with anyone. Trying to connect while thinking I’m secretly extremely evil and unlovable and that I’m taking advantage of everyone just by wanting to talk with them. That everything I say is actually ‘calculated’ and manipulative, despite me being unaware of this. That my side of the story isn’t just shameful and wrong, it’s *evil and vile.*

Avoidant with BPD is contradictory hell. I’m hating closeness and trying to stay away but the other side of me is always getting too close in the relationships I can keep so they don’t leave me. I’m unbelievably stressed because I’m so close to disaster. I hate to vent to my best friend of several years because I feel like I’m being too greedy of her time. I feel like I’m “sucking off all the meat” of this relationship, taking up the space for my troubles, and then I don’t even improve. I know she’s going to leave when she discovers I’m actually a terrible person and that I don’t change. I can feel it creeping towards me and I want to die.

I feel like she’s only my friend because she falsely believes I have potential. I feel like I’ve somehow manipulated her into thinking I’m a nice person. I feel like I’m so much worse than she thinks. I can’t understand why someone would care about me, other than they must be confused thinking of the wrong person. I can’t believe the situation I’m in. It happens every single time, and I never learn.

I get her texts saying I need to try to get help and I just want to sink into the ground and die. I feel like I’ve done something really wrong and should stop talking to her. The answer is simple: stop avoiding therapy. Actually tell the therapist the truth. Everyone is sick of me including me.",Personality disorder

"Anyone else here forever alone? Usually I’m fine, I’ve known I’ll be alone for years, but sometimes the reality of it all comes crashing in. I have so much love to give, but il never get to experience it, being wanted by another person, being loved or being able to love. The thing that 99% of the population will experience, i am denied access to because I happened to receive some shit luck from the universe. How am I meant to accept that? I’ve watched my friends who were just like me, grow into capable adults, experiencing relationships and new friendships while I haven’t moved at all. I’m still the same stupid fucking kid I was at 16, terrified of the world and all the people in it. I am certain my brain wasn’t built for life, not in this world.

This disorder is fucking brutal, it’s completely ruined my life, all I wanted was to be normal. But now I’m doomed to this loneliness for life. And I can’t ignore it, every piece of media, every time I leave the house, there’s love and couples everywhere. And I’m not mad at them, good for them, I’m just struggling to accept the fact that everybody else gets to experience it and i happen to be one of the unlucky few that doesn’t, all thanks to avpd. It hurts too fucking much, the loneliness eats away at you, all I asked was to feel wanted or validated by even 1 human being but apparently even that is too much. It’s not even about the sex at all, I just want to feel someone else’s warmth, have somebody fall asleep on my chest, feeling safe and secure in my presence, trusting me enough to open up to eachother. 

Avpd is so horrible, this loneliness will 100% drive me to suicide, I’m not far off as it is. No human was meant to live like this, I wouldn’t even call it living. Sure you can survive with avpd, but I don’t think anyone can really say they’re really ‘living’, if I knew I was gonna have to live with this shit I’d have killed myself in the fucking womb, I wish my mum did, she deserves better. Sry for the stupid drunk rant, just had to vent it somewhere. I hate myself so fucking much, I never should have existed, avpd is just too cruel, how can this be my life, how am I mean to be ok with that, how am I meant to participate in society like every one else?  I wish I was dead, I should be dead, there’s just no point struggling with the rest of my life if it’s going to be alone. It already hurts this bad, I will not let myself become an old, even lonelier man looking back on a wasted life, wishing I’d have just ended it earlier",Personality disorder

"Why can't I do just one thing? So, I've posted here before, but here we go again:

I work on hobbies, skills, and side hustles very intensely, but never intensely enough to do anything with them.  I have a degree in music education so I'm really really good at researching and breaking things down to the fundamental level in which I can learn them effectively.  I am capable of picking things up very quickly.  It's almost like the huge, dramatic improvements you make at the beginning of a skill or hobby give me the validation that I crave.

The problem comes when I hit a plateau in improvement.  These plateaus where you stop making huge dramatic improvements happen naturally.  Due to my super sick AvPD tendencies, this plateau is perceived as invalidation and rejection.  I'm aware of how ridiculous it is, but it continues to happen.  At this point I basically ghost the hobby and start with something old or new.  Whether or not I retain the knowledge from my ""fixation"" is anyone's guess.

What should happen at these points of plateau is thoughtful consistency.  If you continue to chip away, those vast improvements will happen, but over a larger timespan.  I am unable to achieve that consistency because my AvPD tendencies make it extremely difficult to get past the first plateau of any skill.

Ideally, I wish I could just spend months and months, even years, fixating on doing just one thing so that I can actually see these trees bear fruit.

Here are a few examples of what I mean:

\- Contemporary/Jazz saxophone/bass.  Have the skills/knowledge in order to play and make a nice amount of cash gigging or playing weddings.  Can't use these skills because I lack the consistency to go to jam sessions monthly, network, and learn the songs necessary to operate in these settings.  The intense social aspect of the jazz/contemporary music scene also triggers my AvPD tendencies.

\-Youtube/Video Editing/Content Creation - Built a youtube channel, totally unrelated to music, from nothing to monetized in less than a year, with almost 100,000 views.  Lots of potential for growth.  I taught myself and know my away around Photoshop, Premiere Pro, After Effects, with knowledge of basic filmmaking/editing techniques, audio engineering, etc.  Again, I wish I could just completely no life this and make it blow up, cause I know I could.

\-Programming/Tech  I've taught myself, in a short time frame, a lot about programming, as well as the industry best practices and standards.  I know for a fact that if I could just do this every day consistently, I could turn it in to a career.

I wish I could just pick one of these things and go hard at it every single day.",Personality disorder

I played instruments since I was in grade 4, I was a very talented musician( not saying that in a pretenious way). Music was my life, I was part of jazz music programs inside and out of school , wind orchestras, scored perfectly on all my NYSSMA performances ( New York State Music Association) even skipped a few levels because I was advanced. And part of All County band programs(a hand selection of students to be part of a large bad group that would perform in front of 100's of people). I then moved on to get a scholarship to a music college, I however decided to join the army instead and became a profession musician for them for 8 years, performing for presidential speeches, Veterans day and St.Patrick day parades in NYC, played half time shows at NFL games etc. I used to love just sitting at a piano and letting the music flow through me, sure I wasn't the best in the world, but the raw emotion I put into my music was just a feeling I can't even explain, now it's been over 4 years since I've touched sn instrument and I just feel so empty about it.

"How does one with AvPD even begin to entertain the idea of being in a romantic relationship? To me the idea of being in a relationship like that is the ultimate danger as the level of intimacy in that dynamic is as high as it can possibly be in life. It is just hard to comprehend myself being able to deal with something like that because the fear is overwhelming.  For this reason this is one of the hardest things for me to work on despite making inroads in other respects.

I have learned to personally engage with people in a platonic way, although I have a sort of mental dissonance that keeps most social interactions at a superficial level.  But it seems like that is not a possibility with romance, which is why I have not been able to adapt or understand how to even go about it.  This is why like many other posts I have come across on here, I have virtually no experience at 27.

I'm wondering how others have even begun to be able to make an effort to seek one or even be in one as the possibility of rejection and having to be emotionally open is amplified.  I realize that avpd obviously is an individualized experience and other social dynamics might be more difficult for others and this is not me saying that I believe those in relationships are lying about their diagnosis of course.

"Once I had depression 3 years ago, the reason I wanted to kill myself was because suicide was the only way to get out of the pain that I was fighting. Nowadays, things have changed. I want to live and avoid pain but I must kill myself because I found that I am the very person that meets conditions of a man whom I want to kill.There are several things that help me realize that I must kill myself, but in summary, it is because I could have been a better person in any aspectbetter job, better human relationship, more money, and a lot morebut I have not tried and I will not try. 3 years ago I compared myself to others(mostly my schoolmates who already graduated and got jobs), but now I compare myself to 'the better me' that I could have been. The counselor I met when I got depression for the first time told me to compare myself to 'the worse me' in the past rather than others; but it seems like to work in the wrong way.One major symptom is that I call myself as a third person in my brain. When I swear at myself I do not think like 'Why am I such a shitty ass' but 'Why is John Doe such a shitty ass'. Feels quite weird, when someone insults me and that guy is also me. Of course it is painful. And logically, I have no reason to stop swearing because my father told me not to harm others and I am not one in that 'others' so swearing at myself is not harming others. Not blaming my father tho, for he is the best man I know. I am just abusing his lesson.Of course I have a dream of a happy life in my own way.

"Rabies Anxiety - Long Term Incubation I'm not sure how many of you are familiar with rabies as the subject of your health anxiety, but one of the worrisome things about it is that there have been documented cases where the incubation period after exposure to the virus has been years and years, as high as 25 years in one case (although the evidence for it is not definite). A few other examples of long incubation periods include 4 - 6 years, and around 15.  

My fear here is that despite not having rabies yet, I am incubating this terrifying virus and will ultimately die from encephalitis and insanity, which is the outcome of all rabies diagnoses. 

11 years and 8 months ago I handled two baby raccoons over a period of days my aunt found in her yard after her dog killed the mother. We kept them for probably 3 days, and I would imagine my aunt had them for 2 or 3 days as well, before we gave them to a local animal hospital which gave them to a local wildlife rehabilitation center before release. After dropping them off with the clinic we never heard anything else from them. My father confirmed with me yesterday that he left his contact information. I called them yesterday and they don't have documentation about it that far back, but the woman on the phone was not exactly reassuring because apparently a local, unlicensed person was doing the rehabilitation back then. Still, it's someone who would have had the animals in their care for a period of time that would have seen anything to indicate rabies.

I don't recall the animals behaving strangely, but that doesn't say much. I also don't recall being scratched to show blood (maybe some white-marking from their little claws, but no deep contact) and if they did get saliva on me, I don't imagine it was on an open wound. My aunt, father, two neighborhood friends have not gotten rabies. We never heard anything back from the animal hospital. The only report of raccoon rabies is from 2003, before this happened in 2006. In that county in 2006 there was only one documented case of raccoon rabies in the wild (not humans). For the length of time we had the animals, we would have seen some sort of odd behavior. 

And it's been almost 12 years. What are the chances I'm a case study for long term rabies incubation?

"I'm so tired of trying to be okay. When I don't exercise regularly, my mental health takes a nose dive. When I don't push myself to go into social settings and interact with others, especially friends, semi-regularly, my mental health takes a nose dive. When I don't push myself to switch up my routine, it happens and it happens when I have no routine. It happens when I don't get enough sleep, when I don't spend enough time outside and the list goes on. It's exhausting. And while a lot of these habits/things are enjoyable in the moment, once I push past my ""but I don't wanna"" inner toddler brain, I'm so sick of having to do so much all the time just to maintain ""okay"".And truth be told, lately, I haven't. Life has been unnecessarily shitty and I've had to make so many decisions and compromises on big things like my job and living situation that I crumpled.

"Bipolar doubt I was diagnosed with Bipolar last May after trying to kill myself and did seven nights in a pysc ward which did me so much good.

For awhile before my diagnosis I had talked to my doc about ADHD cause I felt I fitted the symptoms of that so was in shock when I was eventually diagnosed with Bipolar.  When on what I call highs I get extremely productive.  I get so much done and take up new hobbies that never last more than a couple of months.  My lows are never so bad I'm depressed, but I have no energy mentally or physically and no interest in doing anything and I fall behind on everything.  The house gets messy and I struggle to achieve anything.

I have 3 kids so my anxiety goes through the roof when things get messy.  I'm snappy to be around for my wife and my mother and I get into moods because everything in the house is messy again.  It's like a vicious circle.  My lows causes me to let the place get untidy and the mess causes me to spiral into worse moods.

But sometimes when I read what other people go through and mine doesn't seem so bad in comparison I start to doubt I even have Bipolar.  These thoughts sneak into my head, I feel like an imposter and that I'm not really as bad as I think, and I'm only lazy, subconsciously tricking people and cheating by being on illness benefit.

"Those of you that Beat Cardiophobia, I Could use your Help... Hello,

Little bit of background. My younger brother has a weird heart issue. He needed a pacemaker/ICD at 21. Nobody else in my family has it, I've looked into it. I spent a whole summer getting second and third opinions from specialists in the field. I had 24 hr holter over the summer, excercise test and several EKGs. This kicked off my intense fear.

During the late fall, I started developing weird dizziness. I went to the ER twice, back to the cardiologist, everyone deemed it panic. I want to believe them. I'm trying.

The worst thing I've been doing is regularly checking my pulse, and it's always changing. The doctors don't seem to worried though. When I'm relaxed, or even just sitting and anxious, it can be 60. Sometimes it's 107. The more I focus on it, the more it fluctuates. I tried deleting the Samsung health app with the pulse ox but the curiosity always gets the better of me. I felt tired and panicky at work, I had a little coffee, and was surprised that my pulse was 66. Usually it's high when I'm stressed and have caffeine. I made a doctor's appointment and by the time I got there my pulse was 100. I showed him on the app that in the 5 minutes waiting for him to come in after the nurse took my vitals, my pulse was all over the place. 65, 84, 100, 76... He said that was normal.

I just want to be free of this. I want to stop checking and freaking out. If it's high I get scared, if it's low I get scared. The holter monitor averaged my hr at 66. When I'm take it, it seems more like the 70s. I'm seeing a therapist, but the hardest part for me it's believing I'm ok and stopping the hypervigilance and checking my pulse all the time.

"Rapid cycling/unwell while on meds Psych diagnosed me with cyclothmia (bordering on BP2) and I began treatment for it on Feb 1st.

"I am horrible with words and conveying thoughts so a ""she will"" is the best way I can describe this feeling. I remember May of 2018 when I graduated from college. That was a wonderful experience and a serious milestone in my life. I was so proud of my accomplishment and was absolutely elated the entire week through the graduation ceremony. I felt excited to begin the new chapter of my life: starting a new job, making my own money, having my own true apartment. At that time I felt pretty happy.In January of this year I had been offered a new job (after searching for 18 months). I had received a 40% salary increase, had the opportunity to move to Atlanta and move back in with my twin brother. One would argue that this was a serious milestone I achieved after graduating from college. should not I be elated about this opportunity? I have been in the new job for 5 months, the new city for 3 months. As I am typing this post out, I am doing some serious soul searching and asking myself, ""How do I truly feel about this incredible milestone?"" that is just it, I do not feel anything. All I truly feel towards this is ""it is a milestone, and it happened."" Its like there is this she will around me that refuses any emotion from entering. I would hate to use the word ""dull"" but that is really what it feels like. The outward emotion that this entire milestone feels, just ""dull"". And yet in reality ""dull"" is not at all how I should be describing this insane achievement. Honestly, its hard to explain.Side note: I have not been diagnosed with depression but today at work my boss noticed I was making more mistakes than usual so he asked me ""Is everything going OK in your world? Atlanta still treating you OK? Just wanted to check in on you because its not like you to make mistakes. Let me know if you need anything."" Him questioning this made me think about the status of my mental state over the past few days and ""a she will"" is how I would describe it. And honestly I have felt this way for the past year almost, even at my old job. I have no one to talk to deeply about these feelings so I wanted to share here.

"Can Abilify induce hypomania? TLDR: is it the Latuda or the Abilify making me temporarily hypomanic at night?

Long version: 
I've been on Latuda for 3 years, with a 6 week break at the end of a pregnancy (to avoid neonatal withdrawal). Latuda made me feel like shit, but I took it because it's the ""safest"" during pregnancy, according to 2 psychiatrists I talked to. It made me anxious, nauseous, and kind of caused a sundowning effect where I got depressed at night (I called it the ""Night Dreads"").

When I stopped taking it at the end of my pregnancy, I felt so much better, but I know I can't stay off medication. I started taking it again, but the side effects were so nasty that I couldn't deal with them with a newborn. 

My psychiatrist put me on Abilify, but I have to cross titrate. I can't just stop the Latuda. I'm down to 15 mg of Latuda a day, and I'm taking 2.5 mg of Abilify. 

I feel muuuuuch better during the day... more like my old self. However, my Night Dreads have gotten a lot more agitated and started feeling like a mild mixed state. So now I'm wondering which to blame - Latuda, or Abilify? The nausea accompanying it sure feels like Latuda. 

I've been down to 15 mg of Latuda for about a week. I'm debating dropping it completely tomorrow and taking the full 5 mg of Abilify. I'm worried about mania... I have a 5 week old to think about. Can I get some opinions? I'm loathe to give up the Abilify, since I feel so much better during the day now. I have a psychiatrist appointment soon, but in the meantime, I'd like to hear what you guys think.",Bipolar

"Feel like a leech Sometimes a song stops me in my tracks and [this is one of them](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WjxIuZVgjp8).

My mother would tell me I’m exactly the same type of person as the lyrics of this song describe. She called me a sociopath, someone really sick in the head and not redeemable. That I tried to purposely ruin my family’s lives. Like I had a secret agenda that even I couldn’t know about. It’s been the foundation of all of my relationships with others, and helps explain why I get so nervous trying to get close with anyone. Trying to connect while thinking I’m secretly extremely evil and unlovable and that I’m taking advantage of everyone just by wanting to talk with them. That everything I say is actually ‘calculated’ and manipulative, despite me being unaware of this. That my side of the story isn’t just shameful and wrong, it’s *evil and vile.*

Avoidant with BPD is contradictory hell. I’m hating closeness and trying to stay away but the other side of me is always getting too close in the relationships I can keep so they don’t leave me. I’m unbelievably stressed because I’m so close to disaster. I hate to vent to my best friend of several years because I feel like I’m being too greedy of her time. I feel like I’m “sucking off all the meat” of this relationship, taking up the space for my troubles, and then I don’t even improve. I know she’s going to leave when she discovers I’m actually a terrible person and that I don’t change. I can feel it creeping towards me and I want to die.

I feel like she’s only my friend because she falsely believes I have potential. I feel like I’ve somehow manipulated her into thinking I’m a nice person. I feel like I’m so much worse than she thinks. I can’t understand why someone would care about me, other than they must be confused thinking of the wrong person. I can’t believe the situation I’m in. It happens every single time, and I never learn.

I get her texts saying I need to try to get help and I just want to sink into the ground and die. I feel like I’ve done something really wrong and should stop talking to her. The answer is simple: stop avoiding therapy. Actually tell the therapist the truth. Everyone is sick of me including me.",Personality disorder

"Boyfriend broke up with me over my AvPD I was already thinking about breaking up with him just because AvPD made it too painful and scary to be in a relationship even when he didn’t necessarily do anything wrong, but it’s still gut-wrenching. I’m not necessarily heartbroken, I just feel like shit because his reasoning boiled down to “I get you have AvPD and you can’t help it, but it’s your fault this isn’t working out”. He was sick of me constantly ghosting him, never directly communicating or confronting him about anything, and he called me childish for being unable to have a difficult conversation like an adult.

I already feel guilty enough about the way AvPD makes me act without someone I thought was understanding telling me exactly all the ways I ruined this for him, all of which just so happen to be things I already constantly worry are reasons people avoid or despise me. In situations like this, people usually say some shit like “it’s not you it’s me” or go easy on you, right?

Not to mention, one of his reasons was that I was ghosting him while I have been in animation crunch on a tight deadline so I genuinely didn’t have the time or energy to even read messages whatsoever let alone respond, which feels like maybe he should’ve been a tiny bit more understanding of, but in terms of the big picture, I guess I understand. 

It still feels like shit though. I’ve never been broken up with before, and even though I wanted out since the week he first confessed to me, I don’t know if I’ll be able to get over this that easy just because he wanted me to know I was the bad boyfriend and everything I was insecure about, I have every right to hate myself for.

"Tired of ""Surviving"" Episodes, Feeling Demoralized Hi BipolarReddit,

I'm having a rough time lately and I was hoping you could offer me some advice. I was diagnosed with BPD about four months ago, and have had developing symptoms for about a year.

"I am officially broken Im in a city where most of my family resides, but I’m homeless because i’d rather be alone than be around negative people. 

It’s been a few months since i chose this path and I’ve been strong the entire way through it, until now.

Just got out of a short relationship that was bit toxic for my taste. She was basing our relationship off of shall we say, physical aspects.

I just found out on top of that, she was fucking her ex while we’ve been talking and just yesterday she told me that she believes she may be pregnant by her ex, but it’s too early to take a pregnancy test.

So, I acted normal let the conversation flow as it would over the phone until we finished and, I could not stop thinking about what she had just told me.

Next day i told her we should brake up, we did. She blamed everything on me. I kept my cool, explained how i felt. I was ignored.

So, i created distance so i could heal.


But i’ve come to the conclusion that i don’t want to heal, i just want this to end. Ive never been more ready to end my life until today, not because of the break up, but because of everything.

"I am just going to go ahead and embarrass myself off the bat and let you all know I cried at the end of the empathy and sympathy video from the rules. I just signed up for Reddit not long ago and it makes me feel welcome and safe. that is when I started searching for this sub.I had no idea that there were two people most of the time that recognized your problems: the empath and the sympath. I 100% believe I am an empathetic person. When I tell people that I understand what they feel, I can literally feel it. I make other peoples problems my problems. I decide Okay this person is clearly over barren with their difficulties that if maybe I just take a little weight off of their shoulders, they could breathe. After all, I would want someone to do that for me.People can never really reciprocate the feelings correctly. I know that sounds odd. There are no wrong ways to feel, but something about the demeanor of those i help really tears me down. I am slowly giving, giving, giving until I am all out.I can tell that recently my depression is worsening. I cannot tell if it is a hormonal wave, but it is so extreme. I have not showered in like two and a half days. But its been longer before. I am trying to find my footing, but I can feel myself mentally drift. Just a morning or two ago I was incredibly happy I stayed up all night just to clean the house for my mom. She is a handful another post for later. My mom now is so cruel and treats me no less than a cleaning lady. I had a relationship with her when I was smaller, but she tries to get me to hang out with her, I never stay long. Everyone I have ever met loves my mom. The only people who really know what is going on is my boyfriend and my dad. We label her as narcissistic because I did not recognize she was so mean because I was so used to it. Today, I was crying for many reasons. First it was because my anxiety was bad and I did not really have anyone to talk to. Then, it was because I felt guilty that I accidentally kept my exs pictures in the My Eyes Only section of snapchat (my boyfriend did not care as long as I deleted them). I think I might be bipolar. I feel like I am blowing things out of proportion when I say that, but I might need to be reevaluated. By a psychologist, not a therapist that will befriend my mom and become BFFS WITH. I played myself and lied to her the entire time I was her client.

"So exhausted The gravity on earth feels stronger. I am so deep into a depressive episode. I spent the entire weekend in my bed getting high and crying. I only ate 2 meals throughout friday night till Monday morning. One was a box of frozen spring rolls that I heated up in the oven. The second meal was Sunday night, I didn’t plan on eating, I had no appetite at all. But my roommate brought me a burrito bowl because she knew I wasn’t leaving my room, oh and she also fed my cat I had been neglecting… I have zero ambition to do anything, no desire to engage in any of my hypomanic hobbies, no care for my health or future. I made it to work today, which I am actually quite surprised about, but my parents were the type to work even when they’re sick so I’ve always been forced to go to work no matter the circumstances. I just started seeing a therapist a couple weeks ago, even though I should’ve started years ago. She’s got a plan to help me and get me diagnosed so I can start proper meds and treatment. But for now, there’s nothing I can do besides hang out with my friends or go for walks, even though I don’t wanna do either right now.

"Dealing With Friend with Bipolar? Hey guys.

A friend I’ve known for about 3 years sent me some concerning texts and I want to know from others’ experience how to tread lightly here.

I’ve known that whole time they suffered from bipolar and was not medicated. In person and in every interaction, we clicked.  I never thought about their disorder unless they were isolating themselves. In which case, I’d reach out to them with some positive message or offer that we go do something together or share how I had felt a similar way and maybe we can grow together. These times were awesome. 

But recently they sent some texts that were out of character. I asked if they were doing ok (which is often what I do when I notice something wrong) and they took offense. I asked if they had been drinking or smoking and that made it worse. This was all through text. I stopped responding only to say “I understand how you’re feeling” and that’s it. I guess they calmed down but now I’m really nervous.

I had never seen that type of behavior in my friend before. I don’t know if I should just stop talking to them for a while or what?...

"Since April 16th, my top-floor apartment has been leaking (the roof needs repairs) so every time it is rained, it has rained in my home. Dirty, rusty, rain water filtered through the rooftop deck/external roof, onto the floors and countertops. I have maintained it with a bucket, a towel, mopping excessively. At one point during the heatwave in late June, the water dripping from the rooftop had found its way into the basement, landing on and corroding my unit's water heater. You want to be stressed out and unable to shower during a heatwave, all the while being billed for rent? Trust me, it blows. In just one spot alone, I have collected at least 2 gallons of dirty water. The rest landed onto the floor and therefore, into the unit below me.

"Chronic stress symptoms Over the past few years - like most ppl - I’ve had a rough time with covid lockdown, plus then I was diagnosed with hiatal hernia, then divorce, and now financial pressures of single-handedly running a household.

I was hoping to put this all behind me but last summer new symptoms started to appear:

+ IBS / GERD (hiatal hernia)
+ Cardiac arrythmias (thousands a day)
+ Various skin complaints
+ Alopecia Barbae (beard patches)

I’ve now had 9 months of all these symptoms and I’ve tried individual meds like beta blockers, PPI, tweaking diet, exercise with no luck… the docs say this is all because of going through  a major life disruption and it’s due to underlying stress. The cardio and gerd stuff is so bad I’ve started avoiding stuff but I have CBT planned as a last resort treatment. Concerned the stress is permanently damaging my health.

"This is how I took care of my AVPD As someone who has high-functioning anxiety and AVPD, I really found it hard to develop relationships and take them to the next level. I never had problems talking to strangers, and I was just able to easily go about my day unless I am met with familiar faces. I still study at a university and I've tried to invest more effort in socialising, but to no surprise I wasn't making any progress despite exerting more of my resources for 6 months straight.

I thought I was at a dead end. So I just gave up. I turned into this half-dead human who didn't give a fuck about anyone anymore. It felt good for a few weeks, but all throughout those days I had this lingering feeling that whatever the hell I was doing was wrong. My rebellious phase eventually ended, but I was still tired of trying to socialise.

Ladies and gentlemen, if I asked you what your next step here is, what would it be?

You see, us AVPD folks are subconsciously feeling guilty and ashamed of ourselves because we *assume* and *feel* like we are not enough for the people we want to build relationships with. Take my advice and:

***Let us be and feel human for a change. Everyone is imperfect, so don't put up a face or please people, because you are enough.***

Humbling myself was the first thing I did. As I was burnt-out from even trying to socialise, I stayed put, and just became me for a change, I committed whenever I felt like it. There is no secret code, no secret formula, no secret anything to socialising; you just experience the moment and live life at the present. Take good example from your childhood brain, where times where simpler because we still had no idea of the norms and society's symbols. **If you humble yourself, and accept, and approach every situation with humility and nonchalance, you will find peace**, this is the power of kindness, this is where the healing process of ""loving"" and ""respecting"" yourself begins.

Going back to my story, for the first time ever in 7 years, I felt peace. Peace with everything. I don't want to forcefully strive myself to socialise with my peers because that is fake shit. Be of no responsibility. Do take note that I've seen big improvements in building relationships! Of course I was committing from time to time, whenever I felt like it.

So ladies and gents, don't try to divert the river of life, because the water will deliver you to where you need to go.

Feel free to DM me if you want more about how I remedied my AVPD. Peace!",Personality disorder

nightmare related to my bipolar disorder I have been extremely manic the past week or so and a few nights ago I experienced a nightmare that really irked me. I get weird dreams and nightmares quite a lot but this one was extremely unsettling. It started off with me walking down a street in the city I live in and I could see something up ahead so I started walking towards it. When I got close enough I saw a person with a bag over their head being held in handcuffs by two men and was wearing a nightgown of some sort with “BIPOLAR” written across it. They were knocking door to door telling people to stay away from people with bipolar disorder and that they’re freaks. I started running down the street and I passed two children in a window sewing dolls (not sure what that was about but pretty creepy) and after that I woke up.

"Does your anxiety , fear of judgment ,rejection or humiliation stop you from doing daily basic tasks ? Do your triggers replay in your mind constantly ? I can said I have hight functioning AvPD. I go to work , teach my classes .I'm constantly wanting to improve and develop a strong career path and get enough money for surviving in a Latin American country. 

But a few things happened while in quarantine , I was depressed , isolated with my family, grieving that a part of my body wasn't functioning well and got removed that destroyed me and on top of that my religious trauma and the stupid comments of my mother who things all the things need to be her way or not be at all. She hurt me terribly. 

Anyways , as I isolated i created a new perspective of shame and was constantly bullied by neighbors for my attitudes and behaviors as I was bragging a lot due to my  financial and career position were higher than of those adults around me just at 22. I know that's awful  and was against my original principles but I  think I just tried to cope. I'm more mature i recognize it was a mechanism to avoid rejection and shame. Like ""You can laugh or make comments about me ,but you are average and I'm not"". 
I started working at higher education by the time . 

I feel so much shame after all that happened and my avoidant traits have gotten even worse. I barely leave the home. I just go to my job, go home and repeat the cycle everyday. I am going through some medical difficulties  nowdays and I have to come to the realization that I can't live like this anymore. This is not life. I don't do anything else apart from working and existing , I cannot practice any hobbies or watch anything cuz I think that if I sing in portuguese or Spanish or English somebody on the other side of the wall is gonna be ready to laugh at me. 

I don't even talked to my parents ,unless I feel sure nobody could hear us. Sometimes I try doing something and past memories come to hunt me . I tried moving out on my own ,but the fear of being judge for being a female living alone and not talking to anyone has taken me out of the apartment and I've been paying it for two months now, without living there.

About two weeks into us knowing each other, he shared a really intimate story of a traumatic experience that happened to him. He’s a empathetic person that cares for other people, but he gets angry over minor things. I'm 95% sure he's gone to therapy, because even though he will explode at the most random times, there'll be other times when he's really good at conflict resolution.

Before we dated, I invited him to my birthday party. Supposedly, a few weeks before, he was flirting with me, but I didn’t pick up on it. So when I invited him, it confused him. He thought I was giving him mixed signals. On his Twitter (that I don’t follow), he was saying stuff like “playing with people’s feelings is bad” and “disloyal people annoy me”. The next several weeks, he gave me the cold shoulder and really did not want to talk to me.

He’ll also roll his eyes or grunt over relatively things that really aren’t a big deal. Sometimes I wonder if the thing that I did even warranted a sigh or eye roll. I’m just wondering, if I got into a relationship with him, would it get worse?

"My dr said that it seems like I have bipolar and prescribed me lamotrigine I went to my pcp 2 weeks ago for a follow up and was describing what I like to call ‘god mode’ when I can do anything, have unlimited energy, basically feel like I could fight god and win vs the times I get so depressed I can’t do anything except lay in bed and doomscroll. she said that it sounds like manic episodes and depressive episodes (I like my names better) and started me on lamotrigine. my last therapist also said I have bipolar but she was also a quack and I have no idea how she was allowed to become a therapist.

Then i was thinking i need to leave, then I knew i can't, i can't leave i can't have space i am stuck, i need to run, then the room started kinda spinning and i got light headed.  I grabbed a chair and sat down, nobody really cared but if i had not found a chair i don't think i could have lasted without making a scene or passing out.

"My boyfriend broke up with me I'm diagnosed with AvPD and BPD, and my boyfriend broke up with me a few days ago. 

I'm 18 and up until about 6 months ago I was convinced I was completely unlovable. I didn't come from such a great home, and I was bullied for all of elementary school. All I've been told, for all my life, is that I am worthless, ugly, disgusting and just a horrible person. But then I met a guy that made me feel loved, like I deserved to be loved, for the first time in my life. 

We dated for 6 months, then he broke up with me, because I have a personality disorder. I never told him I'm diagnosed with AvPD and BPD, because even though he told me he would always love me, I was afraid that if he knew about my disorders he'd break up with me. Turns out I was right. Because I finally decided to tell him about a week ago, 2 days later he texted me and basically said that he wants to end this. He said he didn't want to be together with someone with borderline. I asked if I did something wrong, but he said he just didn't want the ""drama"". 

I know I didn't do anything wrong, I never did anything to hurt him. But just because I've been through shit he doesn't want to love me. The rational part of me knows he's being an asshole, but the BPD/AvPD part of me wants me to think that *I'm* the asshole. Was he right not to love me? Am I really that horrible?

"Feeling like an empty body with nothing inside. I’m a 24 year old female and I never developed my own personality. I also suspect I have autism because I did a lot of research and I just know my brain is wired differently. I can’t hold friendships and I hurt them because I keep them on a distance. They can’t help me and see mee struggling and getting in abusive relationships because my self esteem is so low. 
Because of this I have a lot of trauma’s. When I was a kid I was neglected by my parents because they were addicts. I lived in a psychiatrical hospital for a long time cause I tried to commit suicide. It wasn’t a serious attempt. I just didn’t know how to get out of the situation. 

Anyway I’m 24 now and I’ve learned a lot so far. Between my 18-22 I did a lot of drugs and I felt “normal”. I felt like people wanted to be friends with me because I was social and talkative and not scared at all. But deep down I knew it was fake. The friendships I build were fake. I tried for so many years to adapt myself to others just to fit in. And next to that I was in an abusive relationship. I was paranoid and stressed. Always scared they’d find out the real me. And I did this for so long I don’t even remember who I am right now. 
I am depressed, diagnosed with ptsd, AvPD and traits of borderline disorder. I asked for a psychological diagnosis for autism but they didn’t think I have enough traits to fit the criteria. I don’t really care about labels but I feel like there is something really wrong with me. 
I’m an alien in this world. It feels so alone.

Sorry for the long text. I’m prone to addiction and Im addicted to Xanax right now. I get admitted to a rehab clinic this Friday for 21 nights and then straight after that to Portugal for intense therapy. I’m glad to have this opportunity and I’ll definitely get out of my comfort zone. I know they won’t fix my problems but it’ll hopefully give me the push I need to work hard. Cause I do believe I can find out who I am and make real friends without being fake. 

I have hope and I want you to have it too💜
We’re all different with different stories but the one thing that is so important; getting out of your comfort zone. Do things that are scary. Take baby steps. Don’t set the bar too high for yourself. Everyone is different so you can’t compare yourself to others.

"People don't take this disorder seriously enough. They're acting like we're just doing this to be lazy. It's not our fault our brains are like this. My birth giver is nagging and cussing me out for not going to school, I understand that this could be frustrating for a parent, but I already told her about my problem with going to school, I risked that knowing that she's narcissistic and judgemental, but even after all the explanations, she still thinks going to school for me is easy. She then goes on to say ""kids these days are so onion skinned"" (which means someone who has shallow tears) and then goes on and say ""I didn't spoil you kids"".

Didn't it ever occur to her that maybe I'm like this because she abused us as children? That she screams at us every chance she gets? That she didn't treat us with respect and neglected us? 

It's not just ""kids these days"", people have been battling with mental health for hundreds of years, it's just ""popular"" now because people actually value mental health now and are seeking for help.

It's so funny because she acts so caring and worried when talking to my teacher, but then acts so judgemental and close minded when talking to me.",Personality disorder

Then he slowly put his hands on my waist and I froze and he pulled me in and kissed me and I fucking let him. I stood there and let him kiss and grope me and I did not say anything. Then he took the rest of his stuff and left and now he is texting me and my depression is back at fucking 11. I just feel like such an idiot, like I have no self-respect and maybe the way he treats me is my fault. If I was not such a doormat maybe he would fuck off already and just let me try to live my life. I am sorry, I know so many people have much more serious issues, I am not going to try to kill myself over this or anything but I honestly have nobody to talk to and my next therapy appointment is not until Wed. I let my ex ruin 4 months of self-care",Depression
"rant went manic, got taken off of an antidepressant and put back on an antipsychotic a few weeks ago, and was subsequently in a depressive slump. so i slacked off and didn't do any of my coursework

then last week seemed to get better. i was still procrastinating but managed to get some work done. was feeling really stable. able to get back on top of hobbies like cooking/baking and reading. disordered eating was getting back in check (i was bingeing for the month before). made time to watch a bunch of movies.

the academic quarter is ending next week. i'm feeling better so naturally i decide to catch up on the coursework i missed. it's a shit ton of work so for the past few days i've been getting something like 5 hours of sleep. well i guess the stress and the lack of sleep is enough to send me manic again despite being on risperdal. fuck this. i miss the euphoric, godlike, powerful mania. i just can't sleep and can't focus. when i wasn't getting sleep for the past few days i was fucking exhausted the whole time and now i feel wired as hell.

Horribly stuck About six years ago I moved back home to take care of my mom with dementia. I was the best chose because I was on disability and had been stable on medication and off probation for a couple of years. The first couple of years weren't so bad she still talked and could walk on her own. I was there to make sure she had lunch took her pills and didn't wander off. Now she's bedridden dosent talk and it's and a struggle to eat. I take two mood stablers and two atypical antipsychotics plus a benzo. I still stuck in painful mixed state. I've have two short hospital stays in the last 9 months. I don't know what to do I promised my stepdad I would see it though with mom but every day  just seams to adds more agitation.

"I’m dating someone I really like and it’s absolutely killing me A bit of background: I was diagnosed with ocd and gad about 15 years ago. Been very much under control for the most part. 

I’m 32 years old and just started dating an incredible 31 year old woman about a month ago. I’ve dated a lot over the past few years, but this is the first time in ages where I’ve REALLY been into the person. Normally it feels like the people I date like me more than I like them, and anxiety doesn’t play a role. I just go about my day with a calm mind and do what needs to be done. But now it feels like the roles are reversed, and I’m getting crushed. 

Constant thoughts of whether or not she likes me, obsessing over every word in her texts to try interpreting meaning, freaking out if she’s doesn’t respond to my messages within a couple hours. It’s taking over my life. My work is slipping, I can’t sleep well, a constant awful sick panicked feeling in the pit of my stomach. 

It doesn’t help that she’s very reticent with her emotions and does not offer much words of affection or validation. But I don’t want to scare her off with my intense feelings so on the surface I’ve been playing it cool the best I can. I almost wish she would just end things with me so I could move on, because not knowing how she feels is the worst part.

"Chronic stress help I really wish anyone can help me or i just wanna know if anyone is experiencing the same things i am because i havent found anyone who has. Im getting headaches/migraines every single day. Its been around 2 months now, this isnt the first time this has happened to me it happened 2 years ago same thing. I had migraines every single day non stop for like a year straight, to the point where i couldnt even eat and developed photophobia and couldtn even turn on my room lights or anything. So it eventually went away after a couple months but im back in here again. Doctors tell me that its stress/anxiety but it just doesnt make sense to me as to why it gets this bad to the point where i cant even get up from my bed or be awake for long hours before feeling pain, no one gets it this bad for this long, 7+ months NON Stop??? So it started around November with panic attacks and anxiety, usually something triggers my anxiety and i can control it, but no not this time it happens even when im happy out of nowhere i just feel bad all the time and super weak, then it progressed to me feeling okay in the morning and bad at night, i always knew id feel bad at night so i would do my daily duties during the day. Then it progressed even more to where i started getting my migraines/headaches every day and the light started triggering them. And now end of march im back in my room again lights off, headaches everyday, cant go out cant do anything, i can barely even be on my phone, lights all the way down and blue light off. I did notice though that it starts in my neck and shoulders and where my arms start on my back. I massage myself everyday, i try to take medications but they all give me extreme side effects even tylenol. I know itll be a few months before i get better, but i wish i knew more people that have gone thru this, i even tried magnesium gummies and got side effects from those as well.

"Don't know if I legitimately messed up my neck or if the stress is making it this way For the past 3 weeks, I've had stiffness and discomfort in my neck. For the first 2 weeks, I'm pretty sure it was a legitimate issue of carrying heavy bags on my shoulders while traveling. It started to feel better but then I felt the back of my neck with my hand and I noticed a hard lump where my skull meets my neck. It seems reasonable that it would be my spine but I've never felt it before now and it's close to the surface and large. It seriously freaked me out and now I can't stop messing with my neck and pushing on it. It is now stiff again and hurts. I convinced it was my own fault from messing with it and being super stressed out again. But this morning I also noticed that when I move my head side to side in a certain position, there is a crunching sound that almost sounds like sand grinding.

"More Clarity, Insight, &amp; Awareness An article I wanted to share with you all to read. Thought it might bring more awareness for yall, especially for the ones who are unofficially diagnosed and highly suspect they may have it. Although I have enough clarity to know I have it (undiagnosed), this is hands down the best breakdown and description of each possible symptoms that come with it. Never heard it like this before. It's not like your typical DSM-5 avpd symptoms that are more generalized and broad. This is more in depth and even more eye opening since I resonate so much with all of them.

"All I am is a useless burden I volunteer at a place that I like to help out at despite my debilitating anxiety because I like helping people (plus It’ll help me gain credit for my future job) but for a few days I didn’t show up due to sickness. Now i’m supposed to text them when I don’t show up, my manager? boss? made that very clear. She even gave me her personal email to text because she understood that I absolutely couldn’t take phone calls due to anxiety. Now I may or may not have just skipped that part as I’d hate to bother them with a text plus it’s embarrassing. So basically my school counselor (who is in contact with my manager) comes up to me and tells me that my manager was very upset and direct that I can’t keep not notifying them when I can’t go and I have one last chance or she’d rather have me not help out at all. This of course (I soooo badly wanna say traumatized, because it feels that way but i’ve experienced trauma before to know that this experience wasn’t actually traumatic) really hurt me.

"how do i calm down when i get anxious while studying? due to mental health i've been slightly struggling with uni studies lately. part of why i'm mentally not doing well is because i've grown up with a rather abusive father and one of the things that he's really forced on me has been to do well in studies, like that's just something that's been going on since i started school

so this brings me to how extremely anxious i get while studying which usually is at home. it can take a while or it can take a few minutes but majority of the times i get so extremely anxious or just straight up have a panic attack in the middle of it. the part that causes this isn't that 'if i don't study well enough and pass this or that exam i'll struggle even more with uni' but 'if i don't study well enough and pass this or that exam i'll en up in trouble by my dad'

ultimately i know it's always gonna be 'study for your own sake, not anyone else's' but after growing up with a father that's so abusive in so many ways, it's hard to not make that association and just break out until i can't even focus on studying

so my question is, making that association or not, does anyone have any advice on how i at the very least can calm down or put myself at ease when this happens while studying?",Anxiety

"So, I just started taking medicine. Like I said, I'm just now getting medicine for this. I don't think I really needed medicine, but my therapist has been trying to get me on medication since last year. I finally agreed to it, and I took the first dose yesterday morning, and the second does this morning.

I have noticed no changes yet, but he told me that it could take a while before anything really changes. All I've noticed is how paranoid I've been that they are giving me a placebo. I want to get the pills they gave me and open up the capsule just to see if there's anything in there, but if there is then is it medicine or sugar? Maybe it's just some sort of powder that doesn't actually do anything. 

What if they are giving me fake medicine? Are they trying to see if I can change just by believing some miracle pill will do something? It feels like they're trying to disprove my Avpd even though they were the ones to diagnose me. 

It didn't help that my therapist told me that he was excited to see what I look like when I'm medicated. What is that supposed to mean? I can't tell if he would just be excited to see me improve or if he is trying to test me somehow.

I don't know. I think I'm thinking about this too much. Anyone have some advice? Kind words maybe? I'm going to keep taking the medication unless something bad happens, so don't worry about that part.",Personality disorder

"How to cope with shame Hello, 

I guess we all share this feeling of shame following us all around. I can't remember much of my life but I can remember almost every time I've felt shame. And I did it a lot of times. So much that even moments of my life that I had been SA are flashing in my mind all day. But other memories are just plain shame, shame of what I did in a specific moment, shame of how I reacted, what I've said, shame on how I was dressed, the way my face looked. What I recognise is that these are stupid reasons to feel shame, and I think anyone neurotypical wouldn't even think is such a big thing. I even felt shame and guilt of breaking things (because anything material has more value than me) . I legit had a panic attack once after dropping a water glass, I wanted to hold the broken glass and squeeze it with my hands until I made them disappear... I can remember most of the times I broke things. 

&amp;#x200B;

How do you cope with these feelings coming to your mind in your daily life?  When I remember one time, I start remembering the others, they are connected and so they come all together to me and make me feel that I will never delete those moments from existence, that they already happened, that there is no way I could live with those things that happened. I feel shame from myself all the time, but when those memories come to me I want to snap out of existence. I don't know how to deal with that. Thank you.",Personality disorder

"do y’all know how to cope with making a horrible, life-altering, career-ruining, bridge-burning decision that disappoints everyone you know? i absolutely ruined my career on impulse after staying up all night drinking alone. i literally cannot believe i did this. i just got a decent job that pays amazing, and it’s gone. i cannot believe i disappointed my family like this. unbelievable.

i spent the night drinking heavily, chatting with random men (nsfw stuff) online to make me hate myself even more than i already do (i’m a lesbian, wtf???), crying hysterically for no reason, slept for one whole hour, woke up still drunk and then ended my career a few hours later when i got sober because i was 1000% convinced i was going to be fired for no reason. literally what the fuck.

One day I was sitting in class and a felt warm all over and then my heart started to race and then I broke out in a cold sweat. I went to the ER and got a ekg(normal), heart attack blood marker test(normal), and a chest xray(normal). While I was there I found out the “funny” heartbeats were ectopic beats.

My primary care sent me for hotter monitor(confirmed benign ectopic beats), stress test(normal), and echocardiogram(normal). This still wasn’t good enough for me so I asked to have a CT angiogram to make sure I had no blockages. This came back clear.

"I just need to vent about my partner. I think my partner has bpd maybe AvPD


Hi everyone. I have no idea how to start this. I’m honestly not even sure if bpd or AvPD is correct I’m just grasping at straws at this point. My (27f) boyfriend (28m)’s brother has been diagnosed with bpd. Which is why this is my first step. And while I’m obviously not looking for someone to diagnose him like this, I’m just lost. And need someone to listen. 

I am massively struggling in my relationship and I just need someone to listen. Even if this goes nowhere. My boyfriend asks for a lot of things for himself but is very hypocritical if I were to ask the same in return. (We just had a long talk so my brain is sort of foggy on details and I can’t quite think of an example of that at the moment) he does ask for things in one moment and when I do them or stick to it, he tells me it’s wrong. Example, he has wanted to get a photo ID for a while. We have two options, drivers licence or a photo card. About a month or probably two ago, he said he needed photo ID for a test at work he’d been putting off. Then he said not long ago that we don’t motivate each other to do the things we need to. I know he has anxiety planning things and doesn’t want to so for our anniversary I said “pick which ID you want, I’ll drive you there, pay for it, and it’ll be done. I’ll put all the planning into it. All good” and he loved that idea. The day we were supposed to go, he was angry about something and it caused an argument. So we didn’t go. Which got pushed off to the next week and the week after. To today. Each week he said “I’ll do it next week on my day off” so I asked and he pushed it again. Today we spoke about it and while he’s not good at planning, I was waiting around to find out if we were going or not, as I wanted to plan when I was done work and went to get gas and groceries. When it was about 2 hours before we had to leave if we were going for him to take the drivers test, I told him that I didn’t care if we went but if he wanted to study more, now was the time. He told me tonight that he only did it so ID shut up about it and when I said “you told me you wanted more motivation so I gave it to you” he just said “fair”. But we always have those moments where he says he wants something and I change to do it but then he gets pissy about it. If I try and talk to him about my needs or what I’m wanting more of or how I’m hurt by something, he tells me that he just wants to be left alone and that he never asked me for anything. Or he’ll just give me all the things about himself that suck or how he feels and completely disregards what I was even talking about. If we have an argument for 1 full hour let’s say. There will be lulls in the argument. Maybe every 15 minutes. Maybe start, half hour mark, and then end. It always changes but the lull is when he sits, listens, and answers me with respect. The other times it’s that I have said even one word to set him off and he’s miserable. And angry and not nice. I’m finding myself constantly working around his moods. Sort of judging if now is a good time to even show him a TikTok or something I find interesting. If he agrees with what I’m showing him, all is good. If he doesn’t, he gets angry. Says he’s confused and basically shuts down. Tells me he thinks that’s dumb or “why would someone even do that. They’re not part of my life. Why do I even need to listen to that”. If I’m talking about my work or just complaining, he’ll tell me why he doesn’t want to hear it. That it’s not part of his world so it doesn’t matter. I’ve asked him certain things to stop or change and whenever I do he’ll tell me something he needs in return. He can’t just take blame for things. Sometimes he can. But normally can’t. I definitely do not help the situation because I am at his every beck and call and he’s at none of mine. If he asks to be left alone, and I walk to another room, he says he feels guilty that I’m going away. And that he’ll just sit and stew and feel bad and then he doesn’t get his way anyway. 

He wants to be left alone a lot. Can’t ever take anything I say and listen. Always has to tell me why whatever I’m going through is something he’d love to have or how his life is worse. Example; we moved for his work. Away from my family and friends and my best friend dropped me. While she was being shitty all the time, she was the last person I had to talk to. And if I’m sad about it, he tells me that’s his dream for people to leave him alone and he doesn’t understand why I’m upset. 

If something small happens, he wildly blows it out of proportion. Especially if it’s something he doesn’t understand. I have to be careful with how I joke with him because he will take everything to heart but has zero problem disrespecting me or poking fun at me for something. If we go out at all, he doesn’t want to be there and will usually get extremely high or drunk to avoid socializing because it makes him anxious. 

I’m just not sure if this is like anything anyone has dealt with and I’m looking for advice or help or just something. Thank you for reading this long novel. I really appreciate you all.",Personality disorder

It’s such a stupid mistake and given the lack of response on the professor’s part I’m thinking this might ruin my chances. I was so proud of my personal statement and had really solid references but now I’m doubting everything about my application and myself.

Edit: I received an offer and have chatted to the prof, everything is good now!",Stress

"Stressing about Studying I am in my mid 30s and have just been given the chance to do an extra year and a half of study in a different University. The degree that I have was more theory based and I really need hands on experience to be employable in my field, which I now have the opportunity to do alongside guaranteed internships and portfolio work. 

My stress levels are currently through the roof about this, as I am worried that I won't be able to match the calibre of current high school leavers, who, even though treated as adults at University, still seem to have that high school mentality. My main issue is, even though not permanent, the dorm style accommodation and the fact that an ""old"" person is living with basically a teenager, although I did apply for a single room with a shared bathroom, so maybe not so bad. 

Usually I wouldn't have a problem with this, but already having experienced this with not much success, I am now stressing immensely. I'm not there to be anybody's friend, but the way I have been treated in the past, just for being a little older has been disgusting. There is not much available accommodation at all in the country, so looking for anything else is currently out.

Honestly, I think I'm just stressing because I'm over 30 and feel like I still don't have my life in order, with another future gap in my resume.

"Convinced I have MS Hey. I can't seem to calm myself down right now... I've completely convinced myself I have MS.. my HA has been seriously terrible lately. I keep having panic attacks and I have embarrassingly broken down several times this past week at work. This post is long, I'm very sorry.

I'm a 21 yo female. I've had health anxiety for nearly all my life. For the past few months I've had pain through my left buttock and leg. Went to Dr who said it was pinched sciatic nerve which completely makes sense (my dad has also had the same problem and it sounds exactly like what I have) anyway I still obsessed over it being a blood clot or something serious. Sometimes when I am very stressed, my arms tend to go weak and I shake. I also will feel numb in certain areas of my body. Recently though,  the area around the left side of my mouth has felt weak/numb when I'm anxious. I always check in the mirror and it's not drooping or anything. It makes my anxiety go through the roof. I also am very aware of my speaking when this happens and I sometimes feel as if I slur my words. It never lasts very long and usually if I take anxiety medication it goes away fairly quick. However when googling this (I know, I can't keep googling things) like the first result is MS.. I can't shake it... Here are my other symptoms...

-very tired. I did just start on two anxiety medications so I'm trying to attribute my tiredness to that.
-I'm constantly tense. My jaw is nearly always tight and my shoulders are always up to my ears.
-tight chest/feels like I'm short of breath frequently. I think I'm like.. slightly hyperventilating at all times.
-frequent nausea. 
-blurry vision especially at night or after looking at my phone for a long time (having it now unfortunately)
-feeling disconnected
-dizzy when I'm extremely anxious
-i get very itchy on my thighs and on my arms. This has happened all my life. Usually if I'm wearing warm clothes, under a blanket, or I've just taken a hot shower (I've always had this and assumed dry skin but I learned that sometimes MS can cause hot itchiness that is often mirrored on the body) even worse, I noticed yesterday that in the places I've scratched really hard, I've even left small bruises and a few scratches.
-for as long as I can remember, I've had this thing where if I'm laughing really hard I lose my grip (can't hold a pencil or something) idk it's weird
-when I'm anxious (sometimes when I'm not) my hands shake
-ive always been pretty strong but for as long as I can remember, my arms shake like if I'm pouring a pitcher of water or something.
-i have also had excema on my hands for the last few years (Dr said due to stress and excessive hand washing which lines up) but it did start out mirrored
-I watched a video yesterday of a man who had been hardcore dealing with MS fears who went to the doctor and he was fine and all. He listed a few of his symptoms, a lot of which I shared. He also mentioned very weak muscles and twitching along with pins and needles in his limbs. I was thankful I hadn't really had any of that. But seriously just a few hours later, all these symptoms hit. Even worse today. My hands have been jittery the whole time I've typed this..

 I know there are more symptoms. I'm sorry, this post is a mess. I'm seriously so scared. Lately all I can think about is my health. I'm finding it hard to do basic tasks and function normally. I'm sorry that this was so long. I just wondered if anyone else deals with this.",Anxiety

"I am not shure if this is the right sub for this but i have to write this down somewhere.I am a 18 year old male avererage reddit user from Germany.About a year ago I wanted to upgrade my Pc and accidently broke it. The problem in having summer vacation, close to no friends and being unable to do your two only hobbies is you have time to think, A LOT of time to think. After about two weeks of doing nothing except of thinking about my past actions and reflecting about my current state of having about 1-2 friends (ig I am still not shure what a friend really is, where do you draw the line?), severly performing under my possibilities and nearly failing my Abitur (Highschool) my mood went downwards fast. After 4 weeks when I finally got my parts to fix the PC the damage was already done. On a daily basis my mood got worse, over time I enjoyed my hobbies less and less, got less talk active (which you can see on this post I usually do a lot) and ate less and less to the point of loosing about 10kg in one week (which is unhealthy but I am overweight so its not that big of a deal) because everything tasted bland anyways and I felt empty anyways. I noticed early where that is going to go but was shure after the last/final school trip in which i had basically a breakdown once a day. I kept going anyways because I did not want anyone to worry but at the same time I wanted exactly that I wanted to see that people actually care about me, not because they had to because they are related or care about everyone, I wanted to see if somebody actually noticed that I am not okay and not just moody. Spoiler: nobody did, apart from maybe my teacher that noticed that i basically went from the most active student in the course to the least active. I cried almost every day. Nobody noticed my mom just thought i wanted to loose weight. My 18th birthday was about that time, I wanted to skip it both my parents (divorced) did not allow it. So i had two partys one with my mom, my aunt and my best friend and one with my dad, gradparents, brother, and my dads patchwork family. Both were stressing me out strongly, all human interaction was hard, I wanted to appear kind of ok even though the suicidal thoughts slowly crawled in my head more and more. I still hoped anybody notices. A few weeks later i was so instable that a simple test in school basically broke me to the point of not even being able to uphold my facade in school. that is where I drew the line, I cannot wait anymore for somebody to help, if I will not help myself now I would possibly do something really stupid later. I went to my doctor. I expected to get told I was overreacting and should calm down. My doctor took me very serious, he calmed me down took some test to check if there was a non hormonal because and prescribed me antidepressants and wrote me sick for the day and tge day after (it was thursday and the second lockdown was the week after anyways). That day was the worst, i basically had to tell my mostly oblivious relatives that I was depressed and i had to decide if I would actually use the drugs I had gotten. After talking with my parents and people I knew I came to the conclusion that I have no real alternativ than taking them. I found a psychologist about 1-2months later way faster than I expected. After about half a year of sucessful medication and therapy my psychologist said they are thinking I would not need therapy anymore, I agreed. I talked to my doctor and quit the meds. I finished school with a grade better than expected. I thought it was over it.But the whole time I knew the only goal I had in finding somebody who cared was unfulfilled. I have not found one person that cared about me, I had to get myself out of there even though that was the only thing i wanted not to do. It haunts me. I had two medium breakdowns this week. I am am fucking scared. I do not want to be depressed again, I cannot go through that shit again. I do not know what to do anymore. Everything turned out fine why am I going down the same fucking road i went about a year ago? Why do I feel like I am not even worth getting cared about?

"I’m worried I’m second choice I met a guy on a trip two years ago. He told mutual friends that he liked me, and he asked them not to tell me, but they did. When he found out that I knew, he cut off all contact with me. Two months later, he and his girlfriend broke up. I have to admit that before he was single, I'd look at his TikToks a lot. I never liked or commented on it; I'd just watch the videos.

A few days before he and his girlfriend broke up, I noticed that my TikToks would go up. I had 3 followers, but whenever I'd watch his videos, a few hours later, my TikTok views would rise. I even tried doing it on certain days; eg. I'd watch his videos one day, watch it two days later, then the day after, and each time I saw them, my views went up, and on the days that I didn't watch them, they stayed the same. This continued for the better part of a year. Last year, it was still frequent, but less so. Now, it's every two or three weeks that we do this. One time, he even posted a TikTok in English (English isn't his first language, and all of his previous videos were in his native language).

TikTok wasn't the only platform he was looking at me on. He would do it on Twitter too. One time, I retweeted a picture of a Star Wars character. Less than an hour later, he posted a meme of that same character. The meme was in English, and it's not that I want to say that the meme wasn't funny, but it was obvious that he posted it just to post it. There's been at least three other instances where he did something similar.

However, twice he did things that tickled me funny. About six months after they broke up, he started following her on TikTok, but unfollowed her within a few hours (probably because she didn’t follow him back). A month later, one of his ex's close friends posted a TikTok video with his ex in it. He started following this friend. Around eight months of this going on, he made his Instagram and TikTok private. I have no idea why. But I can tell he still looks at my TikTok, because TikTok tells who looks at your profile. I don’t post much, and he looks at it every two to three days.",Personality disorder

It itself is not a serious symptom, and I know even if it does happen, it will go away when I stop taking the medicine. I'm only taking it short term, too. I guess basically does anyone else also get stressed out about side effects? Any mental tips on how to stop being so crazy about it? Of course I know rationally that my doctor decided the benefit much outweighs potential risks, and that they always put every possible side effect because that's just legalese and what not.

Because they felt horrible for just making me suffer longer, and did not know if dying would just be the best option for me.I have shared these thoughts with people close to me and it usually ends with them giving up on me. I cannot count the amount of times I have heard stuff like this.Tell me death would not be the solution to all my problems.

Hate that they can't get their issue off, or add their redundant nugget of truth.

"Psychiatrist belittling me First time poster on this sub, but I feel like I need support. Sorry for the format, I am on mobile. 

I feel like my psychiatrist at my most recent appointment was talking to me in a way that made it feel like I was being stupid or taking myself too seriously on what my problems could be. 

I'm diagnosed with a mood disorder and my previous psychiatrist strongly suspected I may be bipolar due to the symptoms I experience. I've been open and shared a lot of my issues with my psychiatrist, but he doesn't seem to care.

What really grinded my gears though was him saying ""well I'm not sure if you really are bipolar because you don't show one of the most common symptoms which is the lack of need for sleep. And I don't mean only needing 5 or 6, I mean more like 2."" To which I had to tell him that no, I have had that back in high school most prominently. I never was diagnosed with bipolar and didn't know what it was before I started my mental health journey, so at the time I didn't think much of having little to no sleep when younger and figured it was normal to go a day or two without sleeping. 

To which he asks me ""well how did that change over the course of time?"" It's called forcing myself to get tired by mentally or physically exerting a lot and also becoming a single parent helps with getting tired a lot faster.

 I felt horrible and hurt because it felt like I had to justify to myself that I'm not crazy, that it's not normal to struggle going to bed before midnight, that feeling crazy swings back and forth isn't normal. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow and I feel like expressing to him how the psych treated me made me feel like I'm being stupid or blowing things out of proportion. I hate this and I hate feeling out of control of my own emotions most of the time, and I just want to be taken seriously.

"Cognitive-Behavioral Function/Dysfunction vs. Mood Disorder I have never felt that my bipolar is a “mood disorder”.  My upbringing and career have made me into someone who is not very in touch with my emotions and moods... I have always been turned off by my pdoc’s suggestion to keep a “mood journal”.

I’ve always seen my moods or moments of happiness/sadness etc as situational.  It is difficult for me to look back at periods of my life and discern any mood swings in the context of bipolar.

Recently, my therapist (a new therapist for me) posed a question: “Are you feeling X or Y? ... those are common in mood disorders...”

My response was to reject the term “mood disorder” as a descriptor for my bipolar.  I said that my experience of bipolar is one of different phases of cognitive-behavioral function or dysfunction. Depression isn’t depressed mood but a decrease in the quality of my functioning (but I can still function if I push myself). Baseline is functioning. The hypomania spectrum is higher functioning (I’ve developed a way to focus hypomania on school/work so I don’t spin out). Mania is complete inability to function [within the confines of societal norms].

And while mania includes a euphoria feedback loop, I see it more than a sub-symptom of delusions- a “mood” that is solely born out of the far-between, brief psychotic states rather than an everyday experience of the majority of my life with bipolar.

And I understand depression and hypomania encompass behaviors and functional levels that are not necessarily strictly associated with moods/emotions, but when it comes to actual moods and emotions, I feel like that is something outside of my bipolar experience. I can stay in bed until noon but still have a great day (or whether I have a good/bad day is dependent on whatever people/stimuli I come across). I can be hypomanic over a work project but then go home at night and get sad due to loneliness. All kinds of combinations of emotionally-neutral activity with situationally-based emotion on any given day.

I do not disagree with this as I have experienced some of these side effects myself.But some people act like their personal negative experience can be universally applied and try to talk people out of trying meds that they might have benefitted from. And that is not okay because everybody reacts differently to the medication so you cannot know if someone else's expierience matches yours.But the worst offender are people that do not know anything about depression or how antidepressants work and come at you with rumors and half truths to get you away from the ""bad way"" of dealing with depression. There is a big stigma against using antidepressants and it really needs to disappear.BTW if antidepressants do not work for you I am not trying to invalidate your experiences.

"Can't think of a suitable name for this post  

I have been blessed with the ability to freak myself right the F\*$&amp; out whenever i think about a host of different topics... anxiety. Now most of these topics ive been able to find categories for, and address in that way, by learning about those things, bettering my understanding of them, and really evaluating exactly what it is that im afraid of. For example, i am a hypochondriac, i have lived with health anxiety for as long as i can remember, but its very easy to find out what health anxiety is, you can easily find other peoples experiences, common coping mechanisms, potential causes for this anxiety, etc. This is the case with almost anything i find myself consistently anxious about.

Now,

One of the darkest corners in my mind that i try to stay out of as much as possible, is one that i cant get a lot of information on, and because of this, i don't know how to move forward in addressing this.

This anxiety / fear is triggered by thoughts of existence, reality, the thought of consciousness... trying to wrap my mind around what it is that I'm experiencing just by being alive in the first place. A good example thought of this would be this:

Whether you are reading this on a computer or phone or tablet... stop and take a second to think about what is between your eyes reading this, and the screen Infront of you, now i don't mean the air, pollen, dust, particles etc. that occupies that space, but the f#$%ing space itself. How? why is that there? what is that occupying? how did it get there?

I experience symptoms of derealization / depersonalization disorder that I've observed are closely related to my thoughts like this, Hell I believed when I was 17 until 20 I was falling into psychosis due to my relentless obsessing over the unanswerable. Its not even one specific mind-F#$\* that does this to me, it's the combination of all of them that represent what we call ""reality"" or ""existence"" that i cant tune out, and the more i try to research these things in my life, the more questions that are left unanswered. i can barely hold conversations with people because of how often i just go blank, returning to being consumed with mulling these things over, IN THE MIDDLE OF CONVERSATIONS.

I feel like most people are able to just curb these thoughts as ""unimportant"" or just set them aside because there's no way to answer things like that at the moment. Boy do i wish i could do just that. Thoughts like this are 25/8 on my mind, I mean I DREAM about inexplicable things that could never be answered, and i wake up, open my eyes and wonder what is this plane of existence that I'm experiencing? how do i retain my persona, my memories, my trains of thought, all of my experiences after so many years?

"(TW: mention of suicidal behaviour) anyone with health anxiety who used to suicidal or still is even? A little long, TLDR at end.

I don’t have many people to talk about health anxiety with as I don’t know many people in my real life who deal with it. Or at least who are open about dealing with it.

A few years ago I got diagnosed with Somatic Symptom Anxiety after I went to the hospital with chest pain and difficulty breathing but it turned out to be a result of weeks of severe anxiety and stress building up and manifesting in some physical symptoms which at that point I didn’t even know could happen. I was paired up with a free psychologist from the hospital who dealt with SSA but unfortunately I really didn’t like him and at the time didn’t respect my diagnosis either. I felt discouraged that I had went to the hospital with real symptoms and worry (my dad has a sudden cardiac arrest in his sleep due to a genetic heart condition - they have not found it in me yet - but we still keep a close eye on my heart) so in a way I didn’t feel validated and thought they weren’t understanding me. It took me over a year to finally accept it and realize that I do get very anxious around the thought of loosing health and death.

A few months after all this I started university and was set up with the counsellor there. They turned out to be great and very helpful. Anyway, they really helped me dive into myself and get some better understanding of my anxiety. They also helped me realize something which is why I’m making this post. 

I had been suicidal for as long as I can remember. I’m currently 27 but when I was about 7-24 I remember constantly thinking about suicide. I always had a plan. I had attempted it a few times as a teen but wasn’t successful. Luckily I was able to get help and turn my life around and start to actually value life. I still had some times where I thought my life is so hard or this is it or my life is getting so disastrous that I should just end it. Now I find myself valuing life, enjoying being alive, and worrying about death/losing my health. I used to be so at peace with the thought of dying and saw it as an escape. And now it absolutely terrifies me to the point it affects my day to day life. 

I sometimes still have suicidal thoughts that cross my mind but I’m in a good place in my life and truly believe that I have put it past me for now. Sometimes I worry if something big or tragic happens in my life I’ll be back to feeling that way but currently I’m good. 

During the time I was suicidal I never did anything that has caused permanent damage (as far as I can tell so far), but I definitely wasn’t living a healthy lifestyle. I’ve struggled with addiction and substance abuse that I have recently gotten a hold on but know it could be too late for some damages the substances can do (mostly alcohol) but I am trying my best to live healthily and make sure my body has what it needs to recover. I think this fuels my health anxiety too. 

I will obsess over a symptom and convince myself this is it. Oh you’re finally enjoying life? Well too bad, it’s soon over. 
 
I know mental health and illness is complicated , everyone’s different, they often intertwine, and more. But I’m curious to know if anyone else has similar thoughts about this or any really.

Thank you for taking the time to read and consider this.

*TLDR*: Was suicidal as a younger person, seems to be gone now, but since I am enjoying life and feeling guilt about how I used to life I feel it just fuels and fuels my health anxiety. Wondering if anyone has similar experiences to share?",Anxiety
"Meds Rollercoaster So I think I've been on pretty much all the antipsychotics now. Right now I'm on Latuda before it was Abilify before that it was Geodone. The list goes on. My libido has gone in the toilet the last year or so. My doc says could be the dopamine being suppressed. So now he's added Wellbutrin to the mix. It's been only one day but I've gotta say I'm getting really sick of these meds and the side effects. I really hope my sexdrive comes back. If it doesn't I think I may consider just white knuckling it and getting off all this crap. I've been on meds since 2001. Started with Risperdal.
Hate that crap. I swear my fingers got fat on that stuff. Has anyone been through this low libido stuff ? Is there any hope ? Has anyone been on an antipsychotic and had wellbutrin added to the mix ? What were the results. Looking for any kind of advice or input. Thanks

"Intense fear of failure Today I found out that 'atychiphobia' is the clinical term for the fear of failure. I've been consumed by atychiphobia ever since my teenage years. I've purposely passed up on big opportunities due to it, and as a result held myself back multiple times.

Well, now I've stumbled upon a hurdle that I need to overcome in order to achieve my next goal in life. I've been looking for ways to bypass the hurdle so I don't have to potentially experience failure, but I can't seem to find any other ways forward.

"My father My father is an addict and overall an incomprehensible and insufferable person. He never gave me nothing. He has never been willing to listen to me, and when I insist on expressing my ideas, he calls me ""punk"", ""alienated"" or ""callow"". He never gave me a useful advice. He's extremely obsessive and unflexible. His neuroticism hits the skies. He talks with imaginary people. He's unable to follow the most basic social conventions, to the point of harrasment in very grotesque ways. He believes that most people, including me, my mom and my brother, are ""zombies dominated by the virtual world and the hegemonic imperial power that displays an upside down world"" (sic).

We live in Venezuela. He believes or used to believe that he was secretely the ""number two"" of the regime, that Maduro qouted his tweets, and that the Intelligence Service escorted him 24/7. He believes that his neighbour, who has been repeatedly harrased by him, owns the biggest child prostitution ring in the country.

Despite coming from a consolidated upper class, white family, and having opportunities in places like San Diego, he never worked. He never provided. My mom, who comes from a family of peasants, has provided everything in my life by nothing but her own hands. When my grandmother died due to my father's negligence, he inherited a ridiculous ammount of money by selling our house. He wasted it all in obvious scams in exchange for literal bottles of rum and whiskey. At one point, I felt anxious about the prospect of him not providing a HOME for me and him.

He has always been a parasite. When he could, he consumed alcohol in copious ammounts and acted very aggresively and disturbingly. He made me cry sometimes. He brought my mom to the brink of madness. His surroundings always smell like tobacco and piss. Now, he totally depends on my mom for survival. He's a eternal thing in my life.",Personality disorder

I grew up always walking behind my group of friends. I could never do anything apart from others. In any social situation it has always been my role to be the child in the corner or the one following the parents.
It doesn't help my father is a controlling sexist. I've never slept out my own house, never dated someone openly (afraid he would beat me up), never visited my friends houses (I don't even know if I can call them friends).
I'm nerdy but not smart. I always got high grades in school, but I never liked being complimented on it because I thought most of my grades came from the cheating sheets I made to remember the subjects before the exams.
If I have to talk with someone for anything, I have a script in my head I have to follow to ensure I'm not saying anything idiot.
After graduating from school, I fell for my relative's advice and did not leave my hometown, preferring to go to college in the neighboring city and work with that relative. Well, we had a fight and I had to quit uni cuz I was fired.
I couldn't muster up the strength to deliver resumes in my city due to sheer shyness.
Five years have passed since then. I'm almost 23 years old. I'm just a high school graduate. No professional course taken, no money in hand, living with my parents...I still don't want to hand out resumes, I don't want to get in touch with people... I long for physical contact, but I don't have the courage to get close to anyone...

"claustrophobia attacks Can anyone relate to this (no advice please)? So I don't live alone, I live a single family member that sometimes has their boyfriend over. I also do work part time in retail which is all I can currently handle. Our schedules usually allow me enough time alone even if I want more of it. Summer is a lot better for me because I can comfortably go outside in spaces where I'll be just as alone so it's extremely rare that I have these attacks during it. To get to the point there are some weeks in Winter that are a perfect storm for AVPD. Our schedules will clash where they'll be home every single moment I am for almost a week on end. For the first  3-4 days I'll get a bit more irritable but handle things   
 and still do ordinary things that involve other people hearing me like music or watching youtube videos and keep up with people well enough online. Though it starts to snowball on 5 usually. The way it comes on is almost like a physical illness. I suddenly feel extremely on edge in the background, I'll start not listening/watching anything and avoiding doing anything outside my room, hypervigilance shoots through the roof, my mood begins to swing like a pendulum, really snappy, and in general human.exe stops working. I won't even be able to really handle having Discord open. Usually comes with tension aches too in my body here and there.

The anxiety and irritability completely socially cripples me to add to the embarrassment so I go through the usual motions like an NPC to the best of my ability and use that break time very strategically based on how time usually feels there. If I'm lucky I'll loosen up a bit much later at night enough to watch some youtube or enjoy some quieter music. The only way I found to cheat it which costs a little money unfortunately is to order takeout food later (for some reason home cooked food doesn't work? I guess it's because I have to do that here with them around) and have my usual comfort ritual of watching some youtube as I eat hoping someone is streaming something I like. After that I may feel alone enough somehow to enjoy some music and mindlessly fart around on the internet. Since the only factor is that it just involves someone elses comfort food they made for me I have no idea why this works. 

It's impossible for this to go on more than a week cause schedules break it up after a week and give me back that time but it can take me a day on my own completely to recover. I noticed this specific family member being home with me too long is the trigger though I don't know if it's just them or others that can trigger these episodes too. It's as if I become to opposite world nightmare version of myself because normally despite my AVPD and CPTSD I'm much more positive and bubbly in personality. As long as I'm (self) medicated correctly and have just enough space I tend to do ok socially. I feel more like a wounded extrovert than anything since I desire close connections but at the same time I avoid everything that would lead to any being formed because I feel closed in on very quickly. There's a lot of tug of war that goes on with me internally like this.",Personality disorder

I think bc I’m so low-maintenance, I attract a lot of very clingy needy people which made me hate the idea of dating because they’d never leave me alone.

"Recovered, but it's too late I suffered from severe AVPD from my late teens into my early twenties. During this time, I cut off my old school friends and then didn't go to uni. In fact, I pretty much became a recluse. 

I eventually started to recover when I was about 22. I'm now in my late twenties, and though I feel I've overcome most AVPD symptoms, I feel like I am too old to make new friends. I've managed to sort of reconnect with 2 school friends, but there was a five year gap in communication so things feel different. 

I really feel like I would've made my lifelong friends at uni, but I didn't make it there. I don't know how to accept the damage that isolating myself during those critical years has done. 

As I've recovered from AVPD, I've realised I'm not that weird of a person, and I can actually get on with people fine. But those friend making opportunities of school and uni have long passed. It now feels like no matter how sociable or cool or fun I am, it doesn't matter, because everyone already has established friends from school or uni and doesn't want anymore.  

Has anyone else experienced this? Recovered but just too late - the damage is done?",Personality disorder

"I have been having depression and anxiety from studying. As a student I have always tried to get the best grades possible with that i was not getting recognition from my family but was still determined to aim higher the year later i started high school with a 93 average and ended with 98 average totaling it up to 96.3. I have always thought that when i get these grades i would get a good job or congratulations from my parents but i was fully depressed when i told them about my final term grade and did not even get a good job or atta-boy which really affected me negatively and i was so sad that i had to confront my mother about this and we started crying and she said she would do better and thankfully it worked but it still lies in the back of my head wether or not if i had said this when my final grades are up she would appreciate or was my confrontation a wake up call to start appreciating me. Even my siblings notice the abandonment i get relating to my studies, where it has caused me to try and aim for the high not to be the best just to be appreciated by my parents.After all that was done in my country there are limited scholarships a person could apply to and with my grades i thought I could have easily got one and by this time i would have choices to pick from but because of covid my grades were insignificant because many students got their grades up by cheating. And there is one month left and I am still anxious if ill get the scholarship i desire and this has trully ruined my mood over the holidays and made me not care about many things i just would not bother to do anything it has been a long tire full journey of studying and not to get appreciated from anyone makes me depressed and starting to not even care about the foundation that i have built i studied and worked hard to excell at every part possible but i could not get the recognition i deserved either from my parents or the scholarships Trauma with studies",Depression

"decreased need for sleep, difficulty taking meds:( i’m not sure where the best place to ask this is. i’m too afraid of bringing it up to my providers so i’m hoping i can seek support here before i mention anything.
i’m diagnosed bipolar type 1, i’ve only had one manic episode that led to psychosis. mostly, i struggle with rapid cycles of mixed mania, hypomania and depression when unmedicated.
the last maybe month or so(?) i guess i’ve had a decreased need for sleep. so much that my psychiatrist noticed it before i did and prescribed medicine for sleep. i’m taking my mood stabilizers regularly but for some reason i just cannot make myself take sleeping medication and these past two weeks i’ve noticed have been pretty worrisome while reflecting on it(change in sex drive and drugs, unlike myself and putting myself in dangerous situations) i’m just really afraid of bringing it up to anybody for fear of judgement. i know how silly it is to have the solution to my problem right in front of me, and i don’t want to make it seem like i don’t care about my mental health.
i am experiencing all symptoms of (hypo?)mania and some mixed features of depression. it was really nice for a few days of this week but just like my first manic episode, the only way i can describe it is like, you’re going so high up on a roller coaster that when you feel it slipping down, it’s scary and drastic and you do everything you can to keep going up just so it doesn’t crash. i feel like im in the beginning stages of that and i really don’t want to do this. the euphoria and attractiveness of mania is incredible, but the constant racing thoughts and heart rate, the irritability and anxiety are uncomfortable and i know im prone to psychosis.
it seems like the easiest solution would be to actually take my prescribed medication, but it is really hard for me. i feel like there’s so much more time i have to get stuff done later in the night and i see it as a waste to go to bed so early especially when i don’t need to. i’m aware of how ridiculous it all sounds but i don’t know what to do to make myself take the medication. i know i have to but i genuinely just do not want to, but unfortunately i know this is probably contributing to mania.
any advice or support would be helpful. thank you all who read",Bipolar

I am not sure if i will get a job, if i do its probably to pay back my parents as they spent a bit over a million at birth to practically save me, and take care of my only true friend and someone i love deeply, enough to supply them for a happy life. if not, I am not sure if i would just like to enjoy my life, knowing the end is very near.

I hate the fact that Reddit leaves a trail of evidence about me that I can't hide from people and make my comments and questions private.  I hate the whole karma and upvotes/downvotes thing.

I also use Facebook groups but I have an account with a fake name and no information on the profile.

"I can't tell if I'm jealous of other people I think I like my life when I am alone. I am happy to be by myself, do my work and my chores, and I have hobbies that bring me joy.

I don't want to join them because most of the time having fun with friends isn't actually fun for me, but the feeling persists and can go on for days. I know it's silly to feel resentful of these other people and it makes me resentful towards myself as well. I just want to make it stop.

"Just a warning. But don't stop taking your meds. Hello, just want to share my experience. Please watch out with using meds long term. 
Especially benzos. 

If you need meds you need meds. No doubts. But most meds don't heal. They're a temporary solution. 

I compare benzos to alcohol.. Very effective for anxiety. Strange comparison? No, they both make things worse in the long term. A benzo addiction is one of the worst addictions you can have. 
My psychiatrist putted me on them for 5 years daily. In didn't knew better 15 years ago. No internet... Very irresponsible from him. 

The withdrawals are insane. I never experienced something like that. Even more  harsh compared to hard drugs (well,benzos are a hard drug). And I did a lot of drugs in the past. I learned from it. 15 years ago I said for every problem there's a pill. Can you imagine that? I was delusional and unaware. 

There's not a magic pill or drug. Sorry I have to say this. 
Maybe I'm saying well known things. 
But use benzos with caution. 4 weeks at max... Or 2 times a week. Otherwise you're in for a very unpleasant surprise that can ruin your life.

But yeah... I'm not a doc...and don't stop taking your meds cause you're reading this. Talk about it with a professional. Ask advice. Do research about the meds you're taking.

"I don't know why I'm so self-defeating. I can't help it. I don't avoid people because I'm anxious, or embarrassed, or ugly, or feel unwanted. People try to make connections with me and I shut them down or ghost them. I just refuse the effort. And it's not because it's unwanted–I wish I had friends, I want to date, I imagine what my life would be like if I wasn't me and it looks like a lot of fun. I don't think I'm actually schizoid or anything. I just don't have the drive to improve my life in the ways I know I should.

I have never been in a relationship, but I have accounts on a couple different dating apps. I put effort into my profiles and then I ignore every message I get. When people try to talk to me in public, I usually just walk away. I don't know why. Engaging at all just doesn't seem possible. It feels like writer's block, only it's going to ruin my life.

It's not like I had a traumatic childhood or anything. I wasn't abused. My parents weren't narcissists. I wasn't even particularly unpopular in school, but even back then, even in elementary school, I would refuse any efforts to hang out outside the classroom. I would never go over to my friend's houses even though my mom always said yes. Most often, I wouldn't even tell her I was invited. And then I would feel sad from the isolation, lol.

I don't really know what the point of this post is. It's more of a rambling vent than anything else. I need to get it off my chest somehow. My family is so confused by my behavior but I can't bring myself to talk to them about it. Somehow it's easier on an anonymous subreddit. I'm not even sure if this is allowed here, since I'm not officially diagnosed. When I was 19, I went to a psychiatrist to get treatment for my OCD. I didn't want to, but the only other option was killing myself, which I wanted to do less. He's the one who brought AvPD to my attention, but he didn't give me a diagnosis that day. He wanted me to come back for follow up appointments to narrow things down. I refused. I don't know why.",Personality disorder

"I hear people singing and music when I get manic? Does anyone else have this happen to them? It's very strange.

I remember maybe when I was 7 I would be confused as to if music was actually playing.

It doesn't happen too often, but it's peculiar when it does. I became more consciously aware of this when I was maybe 13. I remember being restless because I could hear music, but it was too clear for it to be real. I went outside my bed and didn't hear anything.

I was talking to my psychiatrist maybe 2 days ago about it. If you want you can take a quick scroll through my post history, but basically

1. Got sexually harassed badly from a supervisor. He told told me sexual things about my body and told me he liked sliding in and coming inside

2. When I reported it, the manager cut my hours to zero. I have to pay for rent and food, not to mention how it felt to muster up the courage to report it, and then right face retaliation. I've never experienced this kind of devastation before. I can't even describe how painful the act of retaliation in itself was. I was aware I might not be believed, but I didn't think I'd get punished.

So I told my psychiatrist about it and almost cried. I'm still processing this information, and I'm struggling. I really am.

Sometimes it's music playing. More often, actual music will be playing, and I hear an actual person singing along with the song, but they aren't. It's the most bizzare thing. I have to stare at their lips, and they won't be moving. But I hear their singing very clearly.

Has anything like this happened to others before?

But, thank God for meds. I've dipped in and out of suicidal fantasy because of it, but overall, it's been ok. I still have panic attacks when my throat closes up and I have to step away to cough it out and/or drink water. But again, thank God for meds.

I'm not going to ask for a higher dosage yet though. I think I'm stable if not for this happening.  Anyways, that's such a tangent. So I guess that's a question + rant I have for yall.",Bipolar
"Need to vent. I have had a partner for 4 years. It’s a shock to me, as well. But we haven’t had the greatest past. To make a very long story short: When he started medical school (4 years ago, when we first started dating), he wasn’t that nice to me. Some might say he was abusive towards me, especially when he drank. Anyway, he used my avoidant personality as leverage to skew many details regarding our relationship. It turned everyone in his life against me.

Now, my partner has sobered up. It took me a while to trust and accept this change. But the people in his life still haven’t let go of the past. And the truth is, neither have I. I’ve forgiven my partner but I haven’t forgotten how everyone else treated me, even after my partner tried to clear my name. It only augmented the characteristics of my AVPD. It dissuaded me from applying to grad school, seek any professional or academic opportunities… but mainly, it left me with an intense fear of leaving my house because I simply don’t trust anyone anymore.  

Today, my partner found out where he matched for residency. His school hosted a luncheon that celebrated the students who matched. So my partner invited me and his parents; and his friends were already there since they’re in the same class. Keep in mind that I haven’t seen anyone in about 2-3 years.  

After panicking for a week before the event, I finally mustered up the courage to go. I convinced myself it’s not going to be bad. My partner actually reassured me a lot, as well. Well….

Aside from my partner, everyone acted like I was invisible. They went out of their way to hug and greet everyone, and then skipped right over me. Even when I spoke, they wouldn’t acknowledge me. My partner was really disappointed in them but wanted to keep the mood light, so he didn’t confront anyone. He did stick by my side, so I was at least grateful for that. 

It all just augmented my social anxiety, avoidant personality, and even my body dysmorphia. Looking at the pictures I took of everyone else versus the photos they took of me…. I’m really struggling to decide if it’s just a bad day or if I’m really that hideous. It makes me never want to step foot outside again. 

My partner truly has turned his life around and has become more aware of my needs. I love him very much and am proud that he’s grown up a lot during our relationship. Yes, ideally we would’ve never had to go through our dark phase. But he’s helped me in many ways too. I just wish the people in his life were nicer to me.

These is so much on could go into - but right now I just need to know what to say to him. He went manic today and there was a huge fight, then he told me, I started sobbing, told him I'm so sorry I didn't know - it was the son of a  ex friend (for other reasons) who had been a sister to me my while life, an aunt to him, her son was about a year older. I'm guessing this was grade school, I don't know any details after that he went to his room. I've tried to tell him in here and checking on him but I don't know what to say. Saw him after and asked him what I could do and he said leave him alone. He's had a friend over today thankfully they are watching sports, grilling, whatever, in the basement. What do I do when his friend leaves? How do I talk to him what do I say? He is going to refuse help. He said that we are the worst parents we never taught him anything and don't listen to him and we hate him and lie to him. I know that he gets manic and the anger takes over, he had said in the past he wishes he was dead. But not recently enough to have him committed for help. He'd never forgive me for that anyway.

I'm so against getting a crown because it involves drilling away healthy tooth structure so that it will fit. It's permanent because tooth enamel can't grow back and so such a procedure I've been constantly anxious about it since the appointment got booked 3 weeks ago.

"I have struggled with anxiety and depression for 10 years. For the most part I managed it, and I had a decent life and support system. But the past few years everything in my life has gone completely downhill. Its been one thing after another, and just when I think it cannot get any worse, it does. It started when I began to get panic attacks every day, and my social anxiety took a deep dive in college. I dropped out, and have only managed a few classes since then. My mom started having vision problems 3 years ago due to a negligent doctor that failed to inform her that the corneal disease she is had since a teen was rapidly progressing. I have watched her go to all these top specialists week after week for 3 years, and every treatment option has failed. she is always been my best friend and my rock. Watching her go through this, unable to do anything has been horrible. But recently, her mental health took a big turn for the worse. I have had to call 911 on her twice to get her to a psych hospital in the past 3 months. she is truly the only person I have left though. 2 of my closest family members died unexpectedly, the rest of my family does not give a fuck despite my efforts to reach out, my dad is the worst of them all, and I have lost all my friends. I am absolutely terrified for my mom, and I wish so bad I could do something to actually help her. But selfishly, my mental health is at an all time worse.

She has enough vision to do basic things, but she cannot drive, and she needs me right now. No one else in our family understands or cares enough to even call her.

"Arm aches/ symptoms on one side of body Hey guys. I posted here before in mid December about having numbness and weakness on the right side of my body.

I went on a ski trip with my family in the middle of the break, right after Christmas, and I felt no symptoms at any time during that trip. I felt fantastic. As I came home and started to prepare to go back to school, I started feeling anxious that I would fall down into the same anxiety rabbit hole again in the second semester, and gradually the weakness and numbness started to come back. Now that I’ve been back at school for 8 days and the anxiety has persisted (albeit less severe) I’m still feeling tightness in the right side of my neck and in my right leg, as well as weakness and numbness in my right limbs. The symptom that is scaring me though is that my right arm feels dead, and I have aches in my shoulder and upper arm that really change in severity depending on the time and on what my arm is doing or where it is.

I just feel so stupid about this. It’s following the same trends as it did last semester and that all went away when I stopped stressing.

"MS Awareness commercial terrible for my MS anxiety I've been dealing with HA for about 4 months now. Mostly centered around physical symptoms. Recently, past week or so, I've been having this pins and needles feeling in a small spot on my lip thats been coming and going, and some spots in my left leg with the same, but the leg stuff is pretty much gone. I also been having some blurry vision but I've chalked that up to having just started Lexapro a week and a half ago (I hear it can cause that?). Unfortunately I'm still only on 10 mg, likely getting moved up to 20 after a month.  And while the side effects have sure been there, no real benefits so far. Anyone been where I am?

Anyway so I've been doing pretty well with the HA the past couple of days until tonight a MS awareness commercial comes on and all the anxiety flairs back up since that what my HA has been centered around recently. Am I not supposed to watch tv ever? How do you deal with triggers?",Anxiety
"just diagnosed with BP2, feeling lost and looking for inspo. After years of getting nowhere with SSRIS, therapy, and functional medicine, I have finally been diagnosed with bipolar 2. I feel anger at my parents and doctors for not helping me when this started showing up in high school (I am 29 now). I will be starting medication next week after my psych goes over my metabolic panel. I have a good job now (software engineer) and am repairing myself financially for all the excessive spending and credit I took out, but I feel so alone in my relationships and sometimes think I will never be able to be a wife and mother with this disease. I feel grateful for this diagnosis as I can now begin to forgive myself for all my outbursts in the past, but the grief is so heavy over the time I lost and how much this damaged my self esteem over the years. Is it really possible to begin again after starting medication and therapy? Looking for some serious inspiration here. Love to everyone in this community.",Bipolar

"Possible Misdiagnoses? During the winter of 2016 I was diagnosed with bipolar I, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, PTSD, and a few years earlier ADHD. At first I felt that my diagnoses made sense and I was willing to take my meds. While there were times where I accidentally or deliberately didn't take them, I was mostly consistent. I did in fact feel better in time, though there were many ups and downs. The summer of 2017 I felt that my medications were working amazingly. I was productive, holding a job, writing a book, and overall happy. Beginning my first year of college even started off well. Towards the winter I became very overwhelmed but everyone was due to finals. I expected when our winter break came I would calm down. Throughout the break I had very low energy and a few major mood swings. I convinced my boyfriend to go on a road trip to California with me in the span of a few hours. I felt very excited and couldn't stop talking and laughing. Once we got there I was back to feeling depressed and unhappy, even more so because I thought going on a trip would help me feel better. I thought maybe the cold weather was what had me down, but the change to warm weather made no difference. When we got back in early January I took it upon myself to go off my meds cold turkey (which I know is not the best thing to do and I don't want to suggest that to anyone else). I expected my symptoms to worsen from withdrawals but nothing really happened. I was slightly more emotional and less zombie like, but nothing major. Since then I've only been taking Mydayis for ADHD and I've felt a lot better than I have in the past five months. I've had relatively normal moods, getting sad when something saddening happens or vice versa. This leaves me extremely confused. Is it possible that I don't have the things I was diagnosed with? Or could my symptoms just be taking a break? I had extreme mood swings at the time of my diagnoses and even in the summer briefly. I really just want to know if anyone else has experienced this or has any thoughts.",Bipolar

"Inner monologue is brutal One problem I have with criticism, and people offering it, is that I've heard it already. A lot. From myself. I think the worst things about myself to myself constantly. 

The other night, I told myself that I'm nothing more than potential. The reason I'm lonely is because no one wants to wait around for me to finally decide to be a reality. Im walking-empty promises. That encompasses a lot. So when someone wants to ""tell me about myself"", it feels like a rerun. And they hate that. Hate that they can't get their issue off, or add their redundant nugget of truth. 

Idk if that's part of avpd. And its coming off as arrogant. It's not the critiscm itself. I don't mind. More fuel for the fire. It's the attitude that erupts in response to me being unphased.

But its wrong, and I do not want to get better.I am so used to the familiarity of it. There was a certain amount of comfort to those feelings of numb-emptiness, or just plain heaviness. I had my low times, I self-harmed, and it sorta got better for a week before going downhill, the cycle repeating 2 weeks after. It was reliable. It was known. It made the highs feel better.But for a few months now, I have been, by most views, improving. I have less depressive episodes. It went from 3 weeks to 5 to 8. The sadness behind the self-harm is fading, and as it does, the strength of temptations grows weaker.And yet, I cling to what remains. I am not ready to get better. I am not ready to lose the comfort of harming. The depression is part of who I am at this point, and I do not know how to live without it. Perhaps because my depression never had a clear because, there is no closure, nothing in my life has improved to justify or explain me getting better.I am here because my partner suggested I ask if anyone else has experience with this.

"I gave up my old career in return for a happier, healthier life. I went to medical school as a healthy, bright 18 year old, but within the first year I had my first major depressive episode and suicide attempt. At 19 I had my first manic phase - a month long binge with multiple sexual partners, drug use, and irrepressible urges to study all night. Spontaneous and irresponsible acts were my forte; I decided that Morocco was my spirit country, and whisked myself off the next day. I gained a reputation amongst my friends as mercurial and fun, but inside I was imploding; my second suicide attempt followed the month after.

In my mind the problem was Medicine. This stressful, hypercompetitive environment was obviously causing my mood swings; no way was this an organic health problem. So I left med school at the beginning of 4th year, and began teaching Maths - and I was great at it! This career change had solved all of my problems, and I was tippety top flying high fantastic! Life couldn't get better, right?

Wrong. The depression came back, harder than ever, sending me spiralling down into a deep, dark chasm. I was admitted to hospital and diagnosed properly, treated and sent on my way a month later, armed with mood stabilisers, CBT worksheets and a new found passion for yoga. I thought I could just ride the wave, surfing with the sun on my face when times were good, and paddling against the tide when times got bad. I never imagined I'd be dragged under again.

But I was. The stress of teaching caught up. The long hours, the constant need to be 'on' and engaging, the marking, the data tracking, the free time spent planning, the expectations, the meetings - they slowly pulled me down until I was drowning, exhausted from fighting the tide, and ready to accept defeat.

But three months ago I stopped fighting. I left teaching, and I felt the wave pull me up, lifting me toward the surface. Each day that I got up was a victory that brought me closer to sunlight. I chose to leave behind the stress that was threatening my survival and anchoring me to the ocean floor and I put myself first. 

In a few weeks time I start a job working part time as an activities coordinator for the same psychiatric hospital group that I was admitted as an inpatient to. I tutor for an online company, and I'm happy.

I'm not dipping and diving on the surf with the wind rushing past, but I'm not inhaling salty foam beneath the surface either. I'm just sitting on my board, content to be.",Bipolar

"Is face burning sensations something that can be attributed to anxiety? My life has been a big mess since August. A dizziness episode triggered my health anxiety. I suspected MS - did an MRI, an SSEP - they found nothing. Then, I moved onto ALS. Nothing again. Several neurologists said I had nothing but anxiety, and still I kept thinking the opposite.

In January I woke up with my right side tingling/pins and needles, followed by a toothache. Of course, I googled these symptoms and found Trigeminal Neuralgia - a condition that checks all the boxes of a hypochondriac nightmare.

I had a cavity, did a root canal, the toothache disappeared. But the tingling is still here and around my eye I have been dealing with burning sensations - eyelid, eyelashes, inside the eye. It's not unbearable and maddening like those who have trigeminal neuralgia say it is, but it's really uncomfortable.

I've seen two major neurosurgeons about this, they said I didn't have trigeminal neuralgia. I don't know, I can't find peace, I'm always startled, nervous and expecting to be hit by a major wave of unbearable pain. 

I really don't know anything anymore. Don't know if is my HA causing this, or if in fact I have this condition but doctors are simply being dismissive. One thing that makes me believe that my anxiety is the root is that the burning gets tuned down/disappears when I'm distracted. But it hits me again when I'm alone at home working, for instance.

"Manic Depression vs Bipolar I see a lot of discussion on this subreddit about the method in which you choose to explain to people how you “have bipolar disorder” or “are bipolar.” Recently, I’ve noticed that within the context of suicide and famous artists (Chester Bennington, Chris Cornell, Anthony Bourdain, etc), these individuals are often deemed as suffering from “manic depression.” Manic depression, from my understanding, is the former terminology used to describe bipolar disorder.

I used to be beautiful before all these drugs fucked me up. I am super sensitive to medication and I was on erythromycin, accutane, prednisone (a steroid) and the pill. Now I am off everhthing and just on minocycline to control the acne.

"The worst part is the lack of hope I’m always gonna be like this. Even with years of therapy and meds, even while on copious amounts of confidence enhancing  and anxiety reducing drugs, I’m still too socially anxious and awkward. Sure I can force myself to socialise but I can’t force myself to enjoy it, or force myself to relax and just be myself. The fact that this shit isn’t getting any better no matter what I try is so demoralising, it makes everything else pointless, having severe avpd/social anxiety really does infect every little area of your life. I can’t hold a job, I can’t make friends, I haven’t talked to a girl in years, never mind having a relationship. My anxiety is so bad I get second hand anxiety watching people interact on a tv screen, or hearing others use voice chat in video games. 

And as I said, sure I could force myself to ‘get out there’ and maybe make friends or a gf, but I can’t force myself to enjoy being around them. I’d be constantly stressed out, tense, unable to relax. I’d have nothing in common with them, I only ever feel comfortable alone. Living with a brain like this is like torture, craving connections and feeling horribly lonely but being unable to actually make any connections or function in a social situation. I’m technically an adult but I have no independence, I still feel like a child, and I know for a fact that if I keep on going my future is nothing but boring, bleak and lonely. What’s the point of going to an awful, stressful job everyday if my days off are just as bad. My ‘hobbies’ are just escapism, I don’t even enjoy anything anymore, I’m just so tired, I really don’t see the point in going on when my brain is this fucked up and my future is inevitably empty and alone. I’m barely in my 20s but I’m certain I won’t make it to 30, it’s so crazy how fucked up i am, avpd is so awful, it robs you of a basic human need but still leaves you with the desire for it. A longing hunger that can never be sated, the empty void inside my only gets bigger, things are only getting worse. No heartbreak or feeling of loss, nothing to even look back on, there’s just nothing. There has always been nothing, my life is empty and always will be",Personality disorder

"How to cope with shame Hello, 

I guess we all share this feeling of shame following us all around. I can't remember much of my life but I can remember almost every time I've felt shame. And I did it a lot of times. So much that even moments of my life that I had been SA are flashing in my mind all day. But other memories are just plain shame, shame of what I did in a specific moment, shame of how I reacted, what I've said, shame on how I was dressed, the way my face looked. What I recognise is that these are stupid reasons to feel shame, and I think anyone neurotypical wouldn't even think is such a big thing. I even felt shame and guilt of breaking things (because anything material has more value than me) . I legit had a panic attack once after dropping a water glass, I wanted to hold the broken glass and squeeze it with my hands until I made them disappear... I can remember most of the times I broke things.

How do you cope with these feelings coming to your mind in your daily life?  When I remember one time, I start remembering the others, they are connected and so they come all together to me and make me feel that I will never delete those moments from existence, that they already happened, that there is no way I could live with those things that happened. I feel shame from myself all the time, but when those memories come to me I want to snap out of existence. I don't know how to deal with that. Thank you.",Personality disorder

"Update to 'Oh god, I have a date' [My old post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AvPD/comments/zwc806/oh_god_i_have_a_date/)

Hi everyone!

Since you all were so kind I wanted to share my experience. The date went okay, but she kind of felt distant to me afterwards, shorter answers, not really engaging in text chats.  
It felt like she had no interest so I stopped texting her.  
Last Wednesday after a dance class some people went to a bar in the same building. I chatted with her and some other people. It was quite nice.  
Afterwards we had the same way home so we walked together and kept talking.  
She talked about some mental health problems she had and how she was dealing with it, therapy and so on. She was quite open and frank.  
Later when I was at home I thought about how she was in person compared to the text messages. My picture of her had changed a bit. Previously I would have said she was quite the confident woman (I still think she is though), but afterwards I saw that she also had internal struggles and insecurities.  
So, I today decided to ask her again if she'd like to meet for a coffee.  
She texted me back, that she thinks I'm really sweet and it's always fun talking with me, but her life is too ""full"" right now and she has no place right now for another friendship or something deeper. She'd like to keep it at the dance lessons and socials. She is sorry, that's probably not the answer I was hoping for, but she is just trying to being honest.  
I wrote back, that it wasn't the answer I hoped for, but I thought I would get. I thought she was a great person and find her to be pretty awesome, so I had to write her.  
  
So, that's it. I'm a bit sad now, although I knew this would be  coming. Still it's better to be in the clear.  
  
I've given up some hope to find a partner. It's so hard not to be frustrated or be frustrated, live through the frustration and get out of it on top.

"Anyone else have a 'weird feeling' on the left side of their body? Like a sort of 'fullness' or that something is wrong. I've pretty much experienced this since I was an adolescent (I'm 21 now.) So basically, on the left side of my body, specifically the left breast, there is sometimes a benign feeling of 'fullness' and less commonly a dull sort of pain. It doesn't really radiate. Sometimes when it happens and flares up, I feel it the most when I breathe deeply in and out. I do have precordial catch syndrome (which is harmless), but I don't think that's what this is. I'm always convincing myself that it's angina and that I might have a heart attack, but then I remember I've had this feeling for *so long* in my life that I probably should have gotten one by now. Even when I was young, I had an EKG done and everything came back just fine, and a cardiologist I saw was totally convinced that nothing is wrong with me and just sent me on my way. I'm so sick of having this feeling and I don't know what to think of it. And just recently, I've started to have weird sensations on the left side of my left hand, and sometimes below my left breast. There is also a point in my left breast that when I touch and rub, it actually hurts. I'm thinking this may be a muscle strain or tear, but those things don't really last for several years, no?

To note: this feeling isn't constant, it comes and goes. Even when I forget about it, bam, it just comes out of nowhere.

"Constant anxiety and have lost feelings for partner? Okay so there's a lot for me to go through here, and I have to apologise as it is hard for me to explain things as it's hard for me to even understand what's going on in my brain!

I've been with my partner now coming up to 2 years in May, wonderful healthy relationship where there are no issues whatsoever, I'll preface this by saying I have struggled with mental health on and off throughout my life, mainly being anxiety so I have been on Fluoxetine (anti depressants) for the last 2 years, this has been great for me and has helped me to regulate my emotions and feelings quite well and to what I believe has helped my relationship with my partner to flourish and I have felt genuinely happy.

Anyway, cutting to now... Since the very (very) start of the year, just after new years... (obviously) I noticed a lot of anxiety... although it may of been creeping in a few weeks before, It was as though now I felt it full blast, and my inner voice kept telling me that my boyfriend was interested in someone else, and I was then getting strong feelings of them cheating although there was no indication of this, I think on new years eve I had noticed my boyfriend getting on well with his mates and watching one of his friends who is a girl sing (he's a musician and i know the following sounds daft, believe me) so the next day I kept getting intrusive thoughts of that moment and feeling very sensitive around it, as I'm quite insecure and never sing and I know my boyfriend would love it if I came out my shell more in that way (although he's always telling me how perfect I am) It kept going through my mind that he should be with someone like that...

fast forward a few days, I'm still feeling VERY on edge and feel incredibly anxious when my boyfriend isn't really showing me that much affection, or is in his room for long periods of time... I get very panicky and can't seem to calm myself until I go upstairs to see what he's up to, if he's just sat there on his phone with his door shut I assume that he's not wanting to be with me (even though I think having our own space is healthy and have never had an issue with it before) after seeing him just sat there I'll get incredibly upset and more anxious and feel very emotional, may even start crying and it's difficult to stop, I suddenly view my boyfriend very differently?

I'll also mention now that I was never like this at any other point of our relationship, I just started feeling this intense anxiety since new years, also I'll mention that I'm a very sensitive person and feel as though I pick up on other peoples emotions very easily and that I do that a lot with my boyfriend if he is feeling down about himself etc, I also feel these emotions.

As the days went on I stopped getting these anxious feelings when he wasn't always around, but still felt bad anxiety and feeling depression creeping in, as the days progressed I noticed myself becoming more sensitive to things and even hyperaware? (think that's the word) which would cause more anxiety for me, my boyfriend may say something and I would take it in a negative way and feel offended by it and it would cause a lot of hurt and then anxiety is even worse... I would have a lot of moments of just emotional outbursts of crying and finding it difficult to stop just feeling very overwhelmed and so uncomfortable in how i'm feeling, even gagging from what felt like stress and not being able to eat (I'm feeling this pretty much everyday)

the past month and a bit I've been having internal thoughts such as ""I don't love you"" and other horrible things directed at my boyfriend which cause me so much anxiety and even more stress as I try to convince myself they are just thoughts and not real, having suddenly no feelings towards him? getting irritated at little things but still feeling intensely sad over the thought of him with someone else, this person is perfect in my eyes and I love all the things about them that are considered imperfections, where have my feelings gone? It's been over a month and I'm scared they won't return because I know this relationship when I'm not feeling this way, is so good for me and has been the best thing for my life.

I'll quickly mention that I'm 23 now and had a relationship when I was 14 that brought a lot of the very same feelings up but this happened very early on in the relationship (a month or so) with much breaking up and getting back together due to my anxiety and depression.

I'm sorry for the essay but it's really hard to fit everything in, but this is just the summary of it...

Please can I get real responses with this, I really want to make this relationship work and stop this anxiety and emotional stress and be able to feel these feelings again for my partner... I'd hate to think that it's over now.",Anxiety

"Actually losing my mind + new meds **Trigger Warning:** Talk of suicide. Sorry I can't edit the title. 

Bipolar II here with several anxiety disorders and PPD/PPA for funzies. 

I've been actively suicidal (but not attempting) and somewhat paranoid lately. The only reason I don't kill myself is because of my 10-month-old son and a volunteer project I don't want to leave unfinished. 

I should add that I am traditionally very high functioning -- successful career, marriage, healthy baby -- but life circumstances have taken a flamethrower to my world and burned it down to ashes as of late. On a scale of 1-10, my level of stress is at a 13.

I came into my psychiatrist's office sobbing Tuesday morning. I didn't tell her everything, but I told her as much as I could without her being legally obligated to commit me. My doctor doubled my Lamictal dose, added Seroquel for sleep (because I was worried about developing a physical dependency on Klonopin), and added Gabapentin as a spot treatment for anxiety. 

Last night I took the Seroquel as directed. I woke up this morning and my first thoughts upon waking were that I wanted to kill myself and that I was half hoping that my baby had died in his sleep (in some way that wasn't my fault) so that I could be free of the responsibility of being a mother. I'm sure if I walked into his room and he was actually dead, I would lose my goddamn fucking mind. It would be the literal end of me. I have really intense OCD about his safety and intense fears around him dying as a younger infant used to keep me from sleeping. So that was a super strange and disturbing mismatch of thoughts.

With that great start to the day, I quickly downed the double dose of Lamictal, as directed, and tried to get on with things. I walked back in the kitchen to my breakfast and half of it was gone and I had no recollection of eating it. I walked around the house for awhile wondering if I had put the pastry down for a minute and forgotten about it. Nope. I did not find the pastry in another room. 

Almost the exact same thing happened yesterday with a donut. I ate half of a donut on the way to the doctor's office. I thought I had a whole second donut in my bag. When I looked in my bag after the appointment, there was only half of a donut left. I thought maybe a homeless person in the grocery store ate half of it and put it back in the pastry case and I didn't notice when I purchased it (it was a sketchy grocery store; it could happen, though unlikely). I told myself that was insane and that surely I ate half of the second donut and forgot about it. I tried to tell myself I was being nuts and eat the rest of the damn donut, but I ended up spitting it out because I pictured another person's mouth on it. 

Can stress really cause memory problems like this or am I straight up losing it? Why the fuck do I keep having memory problems only around my breakfast? I am not eating very much at all, so maybe it's first thing in the morning blood sugar thing.

Around noon, with the new drugs in my system, instead of wanting to kill myself, I just don't see the point of anything. I had a job interview today that went fine. But all professional jobs just seem stupid to me all of a sudden -- like we are all working on gibberish and acting like it matters. Who the hell cares if we make a new brochure and more people buy a product? I feel like a 15-year-old who just watched Fight Club for the first time and realized capitalism is meaningless. 

I had some other projects I was working on, and I just don't understand the point now. Why would I spend time refinishing a dresser? Seriously, why? I can't think of anything more stupid.

I also had the thought this morning that I feel like I'm on life support but instead of a breathing machine, it's a bunch of pills.

Right now I'm thinking about leaving everything right where it is, telling my husband he needs to pickup the kid from daycare tonight, and just bailing and going to another country until my money runs out. That would fuck up my life and relationships irreversibly. So I might as well kill myself if I'm going that route. Or not. No idea. 

I guess I wanted to write because 

1) I would never, ever admit this stuff in real life because it makes me sound like a horrible person who hates my baby and I would never tell another living soul how bad off I really am. 

2) can Seroquel make me even more insane? Because that's how I feel. I'm thinking maybe I should just up the Lamictal and see what that does before proceeding with the onslaught of new drugs.

**Edited to add:** I am following doctor's orders on the meds. My doctor suggested adding new ones and upping the existing one. I just worry that they are going to make things worse while we sort out the cocktail and I may not have the capacity for things to get worse right now.",Bipolar

"Feel like everything thinks i'm annoying and I'm unhappy with how I never stand up for myself. I've been planning my wedding that is happening in May of this year.

I got engaged a few months ago in January, and at first I felt fine with taking on everything but now it's starting to get into my head and I feel overwhelmed everyday.

My days consist of me working, wedding planning, and sleeping. Most of the time if i'm doing something other than that, I'm thinking of my wedding anyways. If I go shopping there's always something that will catch my eye and remind me of what I need to do or purchase for the big day.

Not only that, but my partner is in another country (LDR) and he can only do so much to help me with it all besides pay for things here and there. I live on my own while my partner lives at home (he's never been on his own before) and i'm struggling to pay for small things like a DJ or even cake.

I've tried talking to him about wedding stuff and he tends to get overwhelmed or be distracted with other things he's doing like gaming etc. Last night, I was talking to him about décor options we had and I showed him our ceremony space. It's on a terrace/large outdoor patio at this nice hotel in my city. I went personally to view the venue a week after we got engaged, sent him videos and photos, and he loved it too! Now when i showed him the photos last night he made a few ""not so happy"" faces and I almost started crying right there from the stress of it all. He kept saying ""I guess it'll have to do.."" and things like that. Felt like I screwed it up so bad.

I feel like a failure, that I picked a bad venue...and to top it all off I have a few people in my bridal party who are being really catty towards me now. They keep shitting on me for having ""bad communication"" even though I'm trying my best and have everything on MY shoulders. They haven't offered to do anything specific but constantly say ""I want to help in any way I can! Let me know what to do!"" and I have no clue what to ask them. Also, a bridesmaid of mine really dislikes my MOH and tries to make me feel like she's not doing ""enough"" and says she feels she's unsupportive.

I didn't even want a big wedding at a hotel. I originally imagined a wedding where I am married at a nice park, have dinner at a nice restaurant and then go to a pub for a beer after to celebrate.

The only reason it became a big wedding is because of my in laws and my family coming, plus a bunch of my friends wanted to go. My fiancé is only bringing 3 family members and none of HIS friends are going to come (despite travelling to Mexico for a wedding recently).

After all this, I can see why people elope or have really really small weddings.",Stress

I eat pretty good and try to get outside as much as I can even though I'm a shut in, agoraphobic. I go to therapy. My problems are dealt with, my stressors are at a minimum.

Why the fuck am I depressed? Why the fuck can't I sleep? Seriously, it's almost 8am and now my schedule is completely out the window. I'm not even hypomanic, I don't have any energy. I've been laying here watching YouTube, eating left over pizza, just kind of doing nothing. I'm so pissed.

The worst part is, there's a cycle! An actual, honest to god cycle. Not just a bipolar cycle where triggers set things off. No no no. This is a biological cycle. You see, I have PCOS. And every time I've gotten my period since I was 9 years old, it's made me depressed, moody, bitchy, argumentative, etc. A lot of the time, I start to think this is all from my hormones and I don't even have bipolar. I'd be even more convinced if my lithium didn't work great within 2 days of my first time taking it, and it didn't run rampant in my family. Alas, I have the family curse.

But seriously, having PCOS is a fucking curse, too. I use the app Clue to track my cycle and I just checked it tonight to see where I'm at and realized why I was being such a cunt to my fiance all weekend and never wanted to leave the apartment. Why I keep falling asleep later and later in the morning everyday and can't get out of bed until the late afternoon. I'm fucking 25 years old! This is so stupid. I haven't been able to have a job in years because of this and I've never gotten any kind of relief from any doctor.

Those fake sun lamps don't help. Melatonin doesn't do shit. Sleeping pills make me hallucinate. I've been checked for any type of vitamin deficiencies. I try to fix my schedule at least once a month, where I won't sleep for like 30 hours. It's ridiculous, it's the same shit all year every year.

I'm so sorry if this isn't really a bipolar post, I think it is because I feel like my cycle effects my bipolar so much that this happens every month. But I could be wrong, maybe it's just all the hormones and my bipolar is completely fine.

"I feel anxious if I'm not studying at the moment and I can't rest at ease Hey! Just need some help managing my stress. 

I'm a middle schooler. My parents never forced me to study. I get decent grades. But I never seem to be satisfied with the amount of work I'm putting in. I'm always anxious, and I'm always thinking that I have to study. 

And If I'm taking a break, lying on the couch, or watching Youtube, I can't be at ease because I still feel like I haven't worked enough and I have to do more. 

I don't particularly like my studies, and sometimes I need a break. But I can't relax because of this. The stress from this pressure is also affecting my physical health, so I thought that I really need some help. 

Anyone got any ideas on how to fix this? Thanks for reading.",Stress

"A tiered approach to medication Lately I’ve read a lot about medications people are being prescribed and their feelings towards them and I want to share my feelings on this. I am not a doctor. 

Bipolar patients need mood stabilizers. Lithium or lamictal. That is what treats your mood disorder and for the most part what you will always need. Other symptoms, either bipolar in nature or created by the mood stabilizer, get treated by other secondary meds. Insomnia? Probably seroquel. Psychotic features? Probably abilify. Tremors? Gabapentin. Anxiety? Stay the fuck away from benzos even if they try to give them to you. 

Is this generally the consensus? I feel like in the mental health community people just think drugs are drugs and maybe something will work eventually. That feels sad from my perspective. I do 1800mg Li along with 10g seroquel to sleep as needed, 25mg bupropion as needed during seasonal depression, and 40mg propranolol for performance anxiety when I need to perform. It’s a lot of drugs, but it’s really just the lithium at the core of it.

I was hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital, and there I was able to stabilize myself after a lot of medication, why talk about side effects and how bad they feel.

And I'm seeing all the good times they've had, the relationships, the weddings, the vacations.

And it makes me wonder if I could have been their friend, or if I could have been doing those things with them. Sometimes I'll think back to what I was doing at the time the post was made or the photo was taken and find myself comparing my empty life to theirs.

"During high school I would cry pretty much every single day when I got back home. I was going through horrible low moods, my sleep schedule was incredibly messed up and I would just want to sleep and stay in bed when possible. I had no drive or motivation for anything, but I just continued with the routine of daily life and what is expected of a high school student. At the time I did not really realise I was depressed, I thought it was just a rough patch that would hopefully stop one day. I knew I was exhibiting symptoms of depression but I never really thought this is depression and I am depressed as though there were something wrong with me mentally, and that it all lied with me as an individual and my character.I then got into University and hoped for a fresh start. I had a decent time there and socially had no problems, but I myself as an individual was still pretty much depressed and struggled academically. This significantly increased my stress and at times my depression and throughout University, I never really had the opportunity to have a pure break because I would have to study throughout the holidays. Whilst I had multiple break downs throughout, I do not think it was as bad as during school.Done with University and back with my family, because I wanted to take a small break from everything. I used to have a lot of problems with my parents, particularly with my mother and my moving back was most probably not best for my mental health. Again, almost like at school, I would cry quite regularly and feel incredibly low with no drive or motivation. Went through two years of horrible fights with them but ultimately, I believe I have finally managed to patch things up with my mother. We most probably have the best relationship right now than we have had for the past 10 years. At that time, I realised that I have been pretty much depressed since high school, driven by my relationship with my parents. I still hold negative feelings towards them sometimes, but we r both working to being better with each other. I got back to University but still am with my family. With the pandemic, I am stuck at home most of the time. I am extremely introverted and honestly relish the time where I am completely alone. However, being at home with studies and my family has been quite stressful and throughout the past year, the stress has been continuously building up. My parents mental health had also been struggling with the pandemic and as I have pretty much since I was a kid, I would support them a lot during these times. This also subtly contributed to my stress. I had not managed to have an actual break, (though I do have long periods of stress induced procrastination) and eventually I messed something up a month ago and had a horrible break down, like the ones I had during the worst of my times back during my old University or school years. I felt like this time, I ridiculously felt the physical effects of stress and depression, and really felt like they could kill me. For what has been pretty much a decade of depression, bad sleep and poor coping skills with stress, I have experienced physical symptoms like pain. But right now, I feel like its all building up to the point of boiling over (or it already has). I am repeating the same cycle of procrastination, self hate, not recovering from feeling horrible and stressed, even though I really do try to go to sleep earlier or exercise/go out for walks. I really do not need to socialise with people and I do maintain decent contact with my friends. I feel depressed pretty much 24/7 when I am not distracting myself with music, media entertainment, socialising. I cannot focus on my studies at all and I am just so tired. I have been tired for a decade and I just do not know what to do anymore.

"i have known for a long time that i was depressed but did not get 'officially' diagnosed until two years ago. i was 18 at the time and my doctor told my parents i should go to therapy but my parents are the type who do not believe mental health is serious and you can just get over it through willpower, so i never went. (i am financially dependent on my parents.) fast forward a few months later I am in college and i try out the school's free therapist. (you get free sessions if you are taking 12 units) however i was struggling in my classes and basically failed and had to drop my classes so I am no longer eligible for sessions (plus the therapist kind of sucked and just spoke over me.) i also had a counselor recommend that i only take 8-10 units per semester since it seemed like 12 would be too much to handle but again, that meant no therapy benefits. i tried finding a therapist on my own and i found an amazing one but my budget could not keep up with her. i make around $500 a month and get paid biweekly so each of my checks are about $250. she wanted to see me once a week consecutively and EACH session was $275 if i remember correctly. in our ONE session that i did have with her, i mentioned that i think i might be autistic or have adhd and she recommended i go get an evaluation for that. i still have not been able to as that is a lot of money. everything on top of having to pay for classes was way too much. i have not been in school for almost two years in fear of failing my classes again.

"Sudden painful lump in buccal mucosa area sort of behind wisdom tooth, should I be freaking out?

It's on the lining of the cheek in a weird sort of muscular pocket that moves when you move your jaw, hence the pain.

"Rehab stories? I have a dual diagnosis of depression &amp; alcohol addiction. However, I suspect I’m actually bipolar (but still an alcoholic). I have been on 200 mg Zoloft for three years and it doesn’t seem to be helping; frankly, I don’t know if it ever did or if life circumstances were what made me feel like it did. I also have therapy but I only see her once every two weeks and I just started seeing her last month. Nonetheless, the past few months have been absolute hell. A lot of change in my life has occurred and therefore stress has followed, but some other things outside of being stressed have also added to it. 
1) I’m a special education teacher &amp; this is my first year teaching. I feel like I’m completely in over my head and like I’m not supported at work. I’m the only SPED teacher there and am constantly overlooked.
2) I moved out of my parents during the summer when I got my job here in San Diego. I absolutely love my apartment and where I live &amp; I’ve always my own space (I grew up sharing a room with my 2 sisters my whole life). While I love it and am grateful to be where I am, I’m alone every single day and don’t have friends here.
3) I’m codependent &amp; am constantly on the lookout for a man who will temporarily fill the void that my ex has left in me. This turns into having strangers come over and sharing my bed with them for the sake of feeling desired and not alone &amp; jumping into relationships that are short-lived because I’m a mess or because they move on.
4) I was drugged by someone I went on a date with who then took me back to my apartment and raped me in my bed. That was on November 6th.
5) My social anxiety at work is through the roof. I feel scrutinized all the time. I’m afraid everyone thinks I’m not good at my job and I’m only there because they were desperate for someone to take that particular class (moderate/severe disabilities).
6) I attempted suicide last month and was out of work for two weeks. They were supportive but my anxiety tells me I’m a burden. This has also caused great concern for my parents who already have to deal with my older sister (that’s a whole different story).
7) My drinking is out of hand and I feel completely lost. When I’m not drunk, I’m numb and my thoughts are too much to handle. When I am drunk, I lose control and slice up my thighs with scissors. That happened just a week ago. However, I’ve been managing my drinking since then, but I don’t know how long that’ll last.
8) Today I tied a scarf around my neck and tightened it until I couldn’t breathe just to see how it felt. Suicide ideation is constantly running through my mind. 
9) My sleep schedule is absolutely fucked. I’m either awake for 30 hours at a time or I have to sleep for an entire day. 

Basically, nothing is getting better. Ideally, I’d like to make it to the end of the school year and then look into rehab options for the summer. I’ve been depressed for three years and this is the worst I’ve ever had it &amp; it is affecting every aspect of my life &amp; I would rather deal with it all now than let it continue to get worse.

"I have never actually been actively suicidal, but the thought has been there ever since my early teens when something pretty traumatic happened to me. It was sort of a back door, you know? But never something I considered going through with in a near future. I did not have a plan or anything really, but the thought of having a way out was comfort enough. Really, the simple thought that ""this will not last forever, it will all end some day"" was usually enough to keep me from feeling panicked and claustrophobic for simply being alive. And growing up I navely thought that life would just automatically get better without me actually putting in the time and effort to make it so. The prospect of becoming an unemployed, depressed and washed up adult did not even occur to me. I was convinced that by this time I would either be dead or having gotten my shit together, have a decent job and maybe even a steady relationship. This in-between sad existence was something I did not expect. 13 year old me would be so disappointed.

I'm always worrying about the future, past things I can't change, things I say or do after im with people, how people view me, if I have a ""too much"" gene.

I feel like I use alcohol and drugs as a way to cope sometimes. Not an outrageous amount but I'll have a big drinking night and then will go a week without drinking cause I've worried myself into thinking I have a problem and need self control. 

I'm so good at people pleasing and acting like everything is fine but I feel like my mind is just in a dark place. Telling myself I'll never make it, that I'll always be alone, etc.

It's really stupid things to stress over. Or at least stupid things to let myself worry about for more than a minute. 

Money is always a bug stress factor- for everyone of course but thats the main reason I think I've never gone to get help. I'm not sure how much it cost to afford the help I need or where to even go. Not to mention the fear I get trying to explain how I feel to someone and them thinking I'm crazy or I'm making it up- how sad to think a professional in this field would judge me....

To make this worse, my therapist is moving soon and im scared i wont be able to find another therapist, especially someone as nice and understanding as them. She has helped me with a lot, and im scared i wont be able to find someone as nice and supportive as her.

"I feel like I'm subtly giving up and I can't stop Background: I'm bipolar 2. I'm a 42 year old man. In addition to the bipolar, I'm autistic and have been severely abused throughout my life. My wife left me suddenly and with no warning after 15 years of marriage. I'm still in love with her despite her cheating on me twice. I blamed myself, but it doesn't change anything. She also left me with both of our kids, who I love a lot, they're 10 and 15. We've decided to slow date again, and see if we can actually be together, but she's already saying it's hopeless before the first date. Yeah, I know, it's a really bad sign, but I have to try for me.

Now: I can't stop sobbing all the time. Like hard, hurt sobbing. I'm in therapy and I'm on meds. I'm not actively suicidal, but I am starting to worry that I might be slipping into a suicidal trance. I think about it daily and I keep pushing the kids into my brain to stop it. I don't really have anyone to talk to because of the aforementioned marriage, there's a lot there and a LOT of people would tell me don't give her a second chance, including my 15 year old. I feel so fucking stupid for still loving her despite the harm she's caused me. But let's get back on subject. Today, when I was signing out of work on Slack I typed ""Bye"" to my boss unconsciously, I've never done that before, it's always been, ""See you Monday,"" or something else. I held my 3 cats each in turn today and just wept and hugged them. I wandered around the house (I work from home) after work and just felt melancholic and went into each of the rooms and thought about memories in that room. I don't know what my brain is trying to get me ready for, but I'm scared of myself right now. I can't really talk about it out loud to too many people because if the divorce goes forward I might lose custody of the kids because of it, even though they've both said they want to be with me and she is the one who left. So here I am. I don't know what is happening, I'm scared and I have no where to really turn at the moment.",Bipolar

"Being the crazy lady I’m 61 now and was diagnosed bipolar 1 at 28. It’s quite severe, I get psychotic and inhabit a whole alternate reality. Despite taking meds religiously all these years, and trying so many different combos, I still average one manic episode per year and they can go on for months. The consequences of the episodes have been serious, especially when younger. I haven’t been able to hold a job and am on disability. 

Unlike many of you that I see here I am often not able to ‘catch’ myself, and once it’s at a certain point I lose all insight and am belligerent if people try to suggest I’m not ok. Last year I seemed to have a good year and felt more hopeful and optimistic than for some time. But that came crashing down when I was suddenly arrested and dragged off to hospital in the New Year (I’d done nothing criminal but I guess I must’ve been acting strange). 

One of the hardest things for me is the shame and humiliation for how I acted when manic while being adamant that there was nothing wrong with me. In retrospect I could have been seriously harmed or worse when I used to roam around the streets at night and do risky things. Nowadays I mostly just post obnoxious nonsense online and get myself banned or blocked. I’ve lost friends, like many of us. That irresistible desire to communicate seeks an outlet, you know?

"Can health anxiety cause cold-like symptoms? Hey guys!

Let me start off by saying that I suffer from pretty strong health anxiety but have recently started therapy to deal with it.

Three weeks ago, the very week I started therapy, I caught a cold. It was a very difficult week as I pretty much thought I was dying.

Anyway, it has been two weeks since it has passed and since then, I’ve had pain in my throat on and off, moving in different places in my throat (sometimes the left side, sometimes the right side, sometimes the soft palate, sometimes nothing at all). Yesterday, after being very stressed out about some work things, the pain came back in the right side of my throat pretty strong. This morning I woke up and now the left side is hurting and I have a ton of mucus insiste my nose too.

Could my brain really be making all of this up? Does anyone suffer from throat pain from health anxiety?

Mum finishing knitting one of her blankets/socks. Mum greeting the dog. WHATEVER makes mum happy, makes me sad af, because mum has depression too and idk how she can be happy. Why cant I be like her.... 

My GF just built a new computer, its her first one, she is very excited to do some vtubing on twitch or whereever. She's so happy about it... everytime I hear her being excited about it, it hurts so hard. When Im alone it even makes me cry (rare cuz im usually way over crying, depression level wise). Also anything else she is happy about, like a new plushie, or whatever she cooked, its always so innocent that it just hurts. (inb4 ppl doubt my AvPD cuz i have GF: I ghost her for about 4 out of 7 weekdays, for no reason at all, cant do anything against it... Yet she stays, idk why.)

The dog greeting my parents. Animals in general..

"Brain amoeba First of all, thanks to everyone who participates here. Finding this sub has been a huge encouragement to me as I've realized I deal with increasingly frequent health anxiety. 

My current concern is with the brain eating amoeba. I spent time in a hot tub that wasn't properly chlorinated this weekend. Shortly after the hot tub, I got in the shower and ummm.. picked my nose rather vigorously. After doing so, I thought about the warm hot tub water, so I blew my nose then used saline spray to clean out my nostrils. 2 times in the last 3 days, I've gotten really dizzy and lightheaded, feeling like I was going to fall or pass out. Today, I've had a bad headache and have felt extra sensitive to light. No fever at this point. 

Allow me to think out loud:
- can the amoeba even enter the brain from picking your nose?
- is it possible that the amoeba would have just been in my nostril, then I helped it further up towards the brain with the stream of saline solution?
- would a headache associated with the amoeba come and go or be constant/progressively worse?

I know a much more effecting outlet would have been distracting myself or using other anxiety relieving techniques.. but I couldn't resist venting on here. I'm struggling!

We only hung out for two days, but after our first day hanging out, the second day, he was really shy talking to me. But our romance was cut short because he had a girlfriend, and made the mistake of spilling the beans about his crush on me to other kids at the resort. He cut off contact with me, but when they broke up a month later, he started looking at my social media a lot. Not to mention, he made a playlist about me for my birthday. We don't even talk, so I don't know if this is some sort of peace offering or apology. 

The second guy ""Steve"" I met a year later, at my job. He and I bonded on the first day of work about growing up in the same hometown, and I told my mom that day about how we bonded over our ""parallel lives"". We worked together for a little over a year. And we never went out or anything, but he would hit on me a lot. But stupid me was either too dense to realize he was flirting or too surprised in the moment to say any good flirting lines back. But a customer asked me for my number one day, and I gave it to him.

I have the option to watch YouTube on a smart TV, but instead I watch it on a tiny little phone screen with earphones when I'm in company because I don't want anyone to see my web or streaming history, even if it's something as innocuous as looking up a recipe or reading an online news article.  I just feel so much fear of someone looking at my internet history although it's generally harmless and boring crap.

I remember being 10 years old and my brother being angry at me because I would turn off the TV and act all shifty when he walked into the room.

When I was a child I would hide my drawings from my parents and classmates because I would be so embarrassed.  That was my first sign of AVPD.

"Nobody knows the length of my depression... I am sad every single day for years now and I have created a whole identity around being this way and i do not recognize anything else anymore. The only reason why I do not come clean about feeling depressed and talking to friends about it or getting diagnosed and actually seeing a professional is because I secretly do not even want to get better, I am so comfortable knowing I am down here and cannot possibly get lower. I feel myself distancing from friends and family and i feel them being done with me and quite frankly Ill be relieved if they completely cut ties. Maybe then i do not have to hide behind a mask anymore and just let me sadness take me over without worrying too much about sending bad and sad vibes onto other people.

"Do you ever just feel one lymph node? Then you feel more and more? Seems like it’s common for someone to feel lymph nodes unilaterally, especially on the neck. In my case it has always been the right side of my neck.
I’ve felt one below my lower right jaw for several years. 

I started feeling again and finding more and they’re all on the right side still. A nice little stiff one around the posterior cervical area. Then today I found a pretty big soft one in the supraclavicular area (feels very long and narrow like an oversized Mike n Ike). Now I’ve freaked myself out. 

I was never worried about my lymph nodes until now since I’ve been able to feel more of them in a descending pattern on one side only. I suppose the good thing is that they’re not big enough that you could see the lumps in a picture or mirror. 

I seldom have an intense itch attack on my lower legs and abdomen. I’d say just a few occasions every couple months, brought on by some physical activity. Last stomach itch I remember happened after a bike ride at night in the summer.

Edit: Had a pretty intense scratching session on my calf after I said this.

Night sweats have happened but are rare as well. They always seem to happen when I cover myself up in a certain throw blanket, so I switched to a more silky blanket and reduced the problems. 

Thinking way too ahead now, I know most common lymphomas are treatable but it’s a matter if my insurance will cover the treatment and what I must do if they won’t. I *could* just hope it’s nothing though instead of stressing about potentially nonexistent financial burdens. ",Anxiety

Unfortunately, not to make anyone feel bad about it, as I know this condition is very hard to live with, but I have been trying to look for some success stories from people here, or maybe just some nuggets of hope from people that have managed to peacefully live this life.

So my question for you, especially maybe for the older people here with the condition,or the ones that have managed to get married or with any other kind of ""success"", no matter how small, what is your outlook on life? What advice do you have regarding managing this condition?

"3 weeks of crazy medical symptoms and scared out of my mind Not sure where to even start. 

Around Christmas time I was drinking pretty heavily and abusing phenibut pretty bad. Once I returned back to work I slowly tapered everything down, but still had lingering vertigo and dizziness. I went to the occupational nurse and explained this to her so she sent me to the ER after seeing my blood pressure through the roof. 

EKG, chest x-ray and blood work all came back okay. Blood pressure a little on the high side but no big deal. 

A few days goes by and I'm noticing my eye is driving me nuts, like it's super dry and irritated. I keep checking it and it looks fine. Check it again and I notice my eyebrow is hanging lower than normal so I panic because I'm thinking stroke and go to the ER. Get halfway there and get this rush of a weird taste in my mouth and I suddenly feel super weak and out of it. My head feels like it's expanding and I can't string a sentence together and my neck and shoulder muscles feel like they're all as tense as they possibly can be. Ambulance takes me to the ER, get EKG, chest x-ray and blood work and they give me a xanax and send me home saying it was a panic attack. 

Next time I'm in the ER it's the same thing. I start noticing my neck muscles are super tense and my heart is pounding and I try to keep calm for as long as possible, but it doesn't go away so I go to the ER again. CT scan, blood work and a small dose of ativan and I'm fine. 

Third time I convince myself sudden proptosis. PANIC. Go to the ER again, same symptoms. My head feels like it's rushing with fluid, neck muscles are insanely tense and I'm freaking out. Checks my eye pressure and gives a quick exam and I'm fine. 

Go see my regular doc and I keep explaining to him it's not anxiety. Never had attacks like these in my life. Did the usual neurological tests when I explained fear of a stroke and it was all fine. He asked me to smile. Asked me to really smile. Explained to him my left arm had been feeling a little weaker than normal and my armpit felt almost numb or inflamed. So he ordered an MRI because he said it felt colder than the other. 

Came home and checked my smile in the mirror and noticed the right side of my face is pretty much paralyzed. I can barely smile, but I can close my eye. My eyebrow hangs lower than the left and my cheek sags a little. I called the ER doc and she said it's probably Bell's Palsy. Probably a ~3 week timeframe. 

So I'm terrified I have a tumor or MS or something. I did have a CT scan that came back clean. The only symptom I still have is the drooping on my face. I keep thinking my left arm feels weak, but I'm not even really sure. It's like the more I focus on it the worst it gets, but otherwise I don't really notice it. Maybe it feels mildly colder. 

Right now my balance is fine. I find my self falling asleep for a few seconds at a time randomly when I'm at my desk, but I sleep like shit because of anxiety. When I'm sitting down I get these weird feelings like someone's walking up the stairs, like you can feel it in your butt from the vibrations, but nothing's actually happening. My vision has been blurry for the past two years, but my eye doctor said it's nothing to be concerned about. 

I don't even know. My doctor is out until the beginning of March and all I want are my MRI results so I know what's going on. Are these panic attacks, is this just bell's palsy brought on my all of the stress of the past three weeks?

I'm fucking terrified. Sorry for the rant. ",Anxiety

"HA with starting new medications A few years ago, I was placed on a mood stabilizer to treat BPD and the first night that I took it I got extremely dizzy, my heart rate spiked, and I spent the next two days in bed unable to think straight because everything was just fuzzy and I couldn't concentrate or find the energy to function.

Ever since, I've been *petrified* of starting new medications. A few times now, my psychiatrist has put me on something and I didn't even start taking it because I would take to the internet to double-check possible side effects and suddenly become too afraid to. I always worry starting something new, wondering if this one will have another frightening effect, if I'll have an allergic reaction, if it'll interfere with my heart condition, etc - basically, I always end up terrified to start taking something, because I'm convinced it will be dangerous, or at least will make me feel worse than whatever it's treating.

Today, after seeing my psychiatrist again, I've been given a new prescription, this time for Strattera to treat the ADHD I just got diagnosed with very recently. Strattera is the only/safest option for me right now, as stimulants definitely will aggravate my heart condition. But so many people online (I peeked around /r/ADHD and a few other places) say it made them feel absolutely horrible, with more side effects than benefits, and now I'm back to being terrified to take it.

"I need energy! So back in September I finally came out of a multi-year depression, and since then I’ve been getting CBT which has helped so much. But I’m still dealing with daily fatigue. I have a fairly light school/work schedule right now and it still tires me out. I feel like I’m really being held back by it and worried I won’t be able to go away to grad school. I’m exhausted from the moment I get up in the morning, and I’m finding it really hard to sit down and write. It’s mental as well as physical fatigue, hard to focus my brain on anything. I miss feeling “sharp”.

I’m dx’d BP2 + BPD + OCD tendencies, but I haven’t experienced true hypomania in a very long time—I’m more prone to mixed episodes/irritability. I *do* experience occasional psychotic episodes (paranoia, delusions, that make my brain feel like it's been electrocuted and often leaves me ""hungover""), but these (in addition to most of my self harm urges) seem to be a result of the BPD as opposed to the Bipolar. I’ve been on lamotrigine (225 mg) since 2012/2013 + went on bupropion (Wellbutrin) almost 2 years ago (200 mg). The bupro I went on to try to bring myself out of depression; it worked a bit, and I tolerate it, but nothing miraculous.

Now that I’m not in a depression, though, and I’m *still* so tired, I’m wondering what else to do. My doctor ran a bunch of bloodwork and my iron was kinda low, but taking iron supplements hasn’t fixed anything. I even tried taking Cytomel despite (hypo end of) normal thyroid testing, but it made me very ragey and I had to stop. My Dr’s temp suggested that maybe it’s the lamotrigine causing fatigue, which is interesting, and I might try bringing it down a titch, but a couple years ago I lowered it a bit (under supervision) and my self-harm urges went up. But I also want to try lowering it a bit for brain fog reasons (i.e., it gives me brain fog).

So! While that’s something I can try, I’m also wondering about energizing adjuncts. Wellbutrin is not giving me energy (or, if it is, I’d hate to see how I am without it)—(nor is it raising my libido or suppressing my cravings; it just seems to have given me tinnitus but I’m still worried about going off it because this is still the most stable/non-depressed I’ve been in years). Tbh at the end of last semester I turned to energy drinks in desperation, and—they don’t make me manic? Sometimes I barely feel them. Still, those are obviously not great to be using. 

So I’ve been looking into modafinil/armodafinil, and Vyvanse … I imagine I would stay on lamotrigine because I overall tolerate it and it seems to be doing *something* … 

Sorry this is rambly, and yes I’ve used search for past threads but—

**tl;dr – Any thoughts on adding modafinil/armodafinil** ***or*** **Vyvanse to lamotrigine? Any other ideas on ways to gain energy? Is this the lamotrigine? The bipolar itself? Something else??**

I really want them to leave me alone so I do not have anything to lose. That must be so great. I could go on a trip, see stuff, sleep in a tent and maybe kill myself along the way if I felt like it.Instead I am stuck in limbo, feeling bad for failing to match expectations I do not believe in, desparing that I cannot ever match my own.

"does anybody else get overly hurt and offended when somebody comments about how quiet you are? 
I’ve been the quiet girl my entire life and I cannot tell you how many times during school and now work I’ve heard people tell me how quiet I am. One of my teachers once called me “the quietest girl they’d ever known” and I would always get called a mute or asked if I ever talked. And I can’t explain why but every time someone says that to me or even pokes fun at me for it I have to hold back tears and just smile or lightly laugh it off. I don’t even know what to say when someone says that and it makes me feel even worse. I would even go as far as to say it ruins my day because my brain just fixates on that and tells me there’s something wrong with me over and over and it’s all I can think about. I hate it. I know I’m not normal, I know I’m quiet, I know I don’t talk much, so why does it hurt so much when someone tells me that?",Personality disorder
"How did you know? Hi y'all, I've been struggling a lot with my mental health. I'm currently seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist but I feel like I'm not getting better. I'm on medication for anxiety and depression, I feel like it's not working and I'm just like I was before. (it worked for about 3 weeks I was on a crazy high, then I started feeling shitty again)I have this gut feeling that there's something more going on that depression and anxiety. I was wondering if anyone could tell me how they were able to get proper help and what they were feeling? I feel like a lot of things in my head I'm too scared to tell my therapist, for fear of being judged or called 'crazy'. Thanks in advanced for any help! ",Bipolar

"Tell me your success stories Quick Bio:
My Dad was diagnosed with MS when I was 23, shortly after having my first baby. It rocked my world. I saw the strongest man in my life quickly deteriorating and it hit me that illnesses happen to young people. This kicked off health anxiety for me and I’ve been struggling ever since. I’ve been convinced that I’ve had MS, Parkinson’s, neuro diseases. lots of various cancers. I’m a compulsive ‘checker’ if I feel a lump or bump. I check it constantly. I’ve had panic attacks that last for days. Most of these symptoms have always gone away with starting and restarting ssri’s.  Basically, my anxiety has given me symptoms that mimic diseases. My mind is obviously not healthy, as if I even hear the word cancer, I can feel the anxiety build. If people I know are going through something health related, or even if I see a young person going through cancer treatment, it triggers it. It’s even branching to my kids. Every headache or complaint, I start panicking about something worse than a headache or virus. I can’t sleep, I obsess and they’re starting to notice my compulsions and worries. It’s entirely illogical and overall just really bad for my health. I don’t want to live like this. I hate being on SSRI’s. I have sexual side effects and I don’t feel like myself. I think they help, but even on them I’m susceptible to panic over things. 

I’ve tried meditating, medications, yoga, exercise. I’ve overhauled my diet. I lift weights and cardio 3x a week. I use CBD oil. 

My question: is this a life long thing? Has anyone overcome this and lived more normally? Has therapy helped you? And if so, how? I just don’t see how talking about it will help. How have you overcome this? I’m so tired. ",Anxiety
"I have to vent! I am so rattled right now. I hate going to the doctor and going makes me freak out. My heart races, my blood pressure rises and my temp always rises to about a 99.0 which freaks my nervous Ass out. I haven’t had blood work done in nearly two years (when I had leukemia anxiety). I am seriously petrified of what could come up in any blood work that is done. I am worried that I’ll find out I’m anemic because I’m losing blood somewhere (I fall asleep on the couch on occasion and it scares me). A new fear I also have is that I will faint when having blood drawn which has never happened before. Earlier this week I built up the courage to go to my allergist so that I could get an update on my meds, I start to tell him about my recent weight gain (from eating out all of the time and being careless with my diet). And he convinces me that there is something wrong with my thyroid from my Zoloft. I am just so frustrated because I want to rule everything out and make sure I know I am fine to get started on getting this dumb anxiety to go away. But I am scared. He didn’t take my blood today but when I go see my Gyno in two weeks he wants me to. I am so nervous. Ugh help!! Has anyone else dealt with this.

I am freaked out by the doctor. My allergist wants me to get bloodwork done and just the idea is making me crazy ",Anxiety
"Getting a bit high... escalating quickly So my psychiatrist put me on Lamictal first, then added Seroplex (SSRI) about two weeks ago.  And two days ago, I finally started getting better. Like a lot, lot better. And I feel I'm getting higher and higher as the days pass. Today I'm missing work because all I want to do is to see some friends and climb a building. I wanted to watch a TV show but I can't since I just wanna dance and sing and do something. All my apartment's completely clean (much thank's to high me) so there's no much to do here.

I feel like my chest is heavy as shit, my arms and my legs need to move. I've been getting no more than 4 hours of sleep last days.  I felt great... Now I feel just awesome.

And I just can't get out of my head I should buy anything I think of, like this TV which is around 2000$ while I have an income of barely half that. It feels right and the right time. Don't know what to do. But guess what, I'M GONNA CLIMB A BUILDING. No worry, pretty safe though.

"1am thoughts Lord help me. 
I need your guidance for what to do with my life. 
I need someone to talk to. My life is a disappointment. 

I want to give back to my parents, what I am now is because of them. It hurts me seeing them getting old as time goes by.

 I haven't achieved anything in life. My thoughts are drowning me. Always too tired even without doing anything. Tired of life, only sleep is my therapy. 

My partner has her own problems, she's too busy with everything. My closest friends have left me. I dont want my parents to worry. My brother has his own family. I don't have anyone to confide to. Life is draining me to my core. 

Never felt so alone in my life. People are around me everyday but no one seems to care. I've been pretending to be okay for the longest time. I'm no longer my previous self, the confident one, the know it all, the positive guy. I have no ambition, no expectations, all I care now is how to finish the day. This has been my lowest state, my whole body is aching, my soul is hurting, my brain decided to stopped working. 

I miss myself. I miss being happy. I miss being at the moment. I miss celebrating life. I miss being intimate with someone. I miss competing. I miss my family. I miss my friends. I miss waking up excited. I miss caring. I miss eating with people. I miss being motivated. I miss having a purpose. I miss having a goal.

"Don't know who to believe.. I was diagnosed BP2 about 2 months ago after a very scary breakdown. I have always had highs and lows, but sometimes reading about Mania is just not what I've ever felt. Maybe its hypomania, but can't that just mean I'm energetic and feeling good? I know I struggle with depression, and have all my life. After I got my diagnosis, I got really up up up and dyed my hair pink- and went out drinking a lot. Is that mania? Or just me? I always have had suicidal thoughts, and my imagination is just really strong. Now the more I read about BP I am learning that some of what I thought was just normal, are my own delusions or hallucinations. Like, not everyone feels like this. Which also makes me question everything. 

Which makes me feel weird. I feel like I don't know who to believe. My psych definitely thinks I have bipolar. My S/O also thinks I have it. However some friends I have told say that I am fine. That I am in a toxic relationship that is making me question my sanity. Now I've got all this lithium cursing through my body that is probably also contributing to me questioning my diagnosis.

"Am I in an abusive relationship? I have been with my partner for a little over 9 years now. We have had our ups and downs. I've done things in the relationship during manic episodes that I am not proud of. I've sought sexual relationships (mainly sexting) with others, been emotionally abusive, and quite manipulative. This was primarily during times before I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 and on a solid medication/therapy regiment. Now, I feel like I am the partner they need.

Howerve, and here's the rub, I have a sinking suspicion she is not the partner I need. She isn't supportive anymore and is somewhat condescending. She is constantly reminding me of all the past pain I have caused, and when I bring up that it was in the past she just says that I am not taking responsibility for that pain. Recently, she has gone so far as to comment on my appearance, calling my beard pubes and asking me to shave so she can find me attractive again. She brags to others that she got me to shave and belittles me in front of friends. She fights with me anytime I bring up a change that I wish to see in the relationship. She has commented on my weight. SHe has commented on my ability to be a father. She has accused me of having inappropriate emotional relationships with friends. 

I am honestly not sure if deserve this. I did emotionally cheat on her. I have verbally accosted her. I have been mean, aggressive, and manipulative in my own. These actions are mainly when I am manic and being confronted. I become incredibly defensive, to the point that I will be this way.

I know the relationship sick and that we need to speak with a couples counselor, but I am afraid that my partner will just listen and not change. Now, she used to be quite supportive. She took me in when I had no place to go after coming back from Afghanistan. She dealt with my PTSD. She has loved me through so much. I just am hurt by the way she is currently treating me.",Bipolar
"I just realised I don't seem to make friends Soooo...I'm 44 years old. I have a group of about 15 friends in my home town (in another state to where I live), but 14 of them I did not make. ALL of those 14 were made by my best friend back in school (who I befriended at age 14), who is quite outgoing. And then we just had this friendship group which started at 4 and then eventually grew, and I count them all as my friends, but I never actually made any of them myself.

I made not a single friend in university. I made 2 friends at my first job when I was 22, but we never saw each other outside the workplace and I haven't heard from them in 20 years, since I left there.

I made 2 friends at a subsequent workplace when I was about 30, but one kind of kept trying to be my friend SO insistently that eventually I gave in, and she was fun and nice, but I haven't seen her for over 10 years. The other one I realised later was my Favourite Person / FP (BPD lingo), and that is the only reason I was interested enough to want to get to know her and want her to get to know me. I had a platonic crush on her. Even so, after 2 years, my interest fizzled and I haven't heard from her since, also about 10 years ago.

Then, when I was 40, I made a friend here in my building (she lives in my home town most of the year but has a place here too), and she became my Favourite Person, which again, is why I let her in and we became close. Again, my feelings of attraction fizzled after about 2 years and we're still friends, but I hardly see her as she doesn't live here most of the time.

So, I feel like my friends are all mainly made via my original friend, who I made at age 14. And now, 30 years later...I still don't really have any friends and haven't really made any.

"Health Anxiety flare-up Hey guys. I'm having a miserable time lately. Just some background: I'm a generally healthy 32 year old female. My HA is out of control the last few months. It started in December when I got a (possible?) eczema patch/dry skin on my cheek after a bad cold. I was convinced it was precancerous or the beginning of rosacea. It eventually went away with moisturizing. Didn't stop me from googling the crap out of it, and worrying, and asking my husband to look at it and reassure me. He of course was thrilled with this 😜

Around that time in December, I started to eat a big salad everyday/just upped my veggie intake in general to help lose more weight. This made me gassy, and gave me loose stools. At the beginning of January, I started having some soft, thin stools. This has continued off and on. I have mostly normal stools, but if I go more than once a day, my second is sometimes narrow. This has really scared me, and caused a ton of googling, and symptom checking. 

Yesterday, I noticed a few small streaks of bright red blood on my normal stool toward the end of it. It happened again today with my first bowel movement. I spent pretty much all day yesterday googling, and trying to get a look at what I think is a hemorrhoid. I'm just freaking out. Of course, I'm scared I have cancer. I have an appt with a PCP tomorrow morning re: the blood, which I'm really nervous about. I'm the kind of HA sufferer that hates going to the doctor. 

I also just found out I'm pregnant again (with my third) yesterday, I'm about 4 weeks. I haven't told my husband yet. I'm of course worrying about whatever horrible GI disease I may have, and the impact on this pregnancy.

I started therapy for HA about a month ago. My therapist had told me I need to stop googling and reassurance seeking, but it's so hard, especially with the onset of a scary symptom. Feeling like a failure for googling and symptom checking so much lately. Anyway, I just wanted to share with some people who probably get what I'm going through. ",Anxiety

"I am one of those former gifted kids that was in all the advanced classes basically until I hit high school and got depressed. Then I was just passing regular classes with ok grades, no problem. Parents are evangelical christians and think that therapy is either just for literal psychopaths or an excuse for me to get hooked on drugs. Fine, whatever, I can live without it. I hit college and things go ok for a couple of years. Then the pandemic hits, and everything goes to hell. Its so easy with online classes to say Ill do it later, especially when they are asynchronous. Ill do it later turns into Ill do two days worth of work tomorrow and then I can catch up on everything over the weekend. Except, you never do. And then the anxiety hits, and you feel awful for not doing work, so its on your mind 24/7. But you do not actually have the motivation to go do the work, and you end up burying yourself in some instant gratification trying to hide from the anxiety and get out of actually putting effort into anything. Except, this just feeds the anxiety more, which makes you delve into more instant gratification, and the cycle repeats endlessly. This has been my life for the past year and a half. Its maddening, and I honestly regret not killing myself when I was 16. At least then I would not have to deal with this. Even with only one class to focus on this summer the cycle is as vicious as ever, with no end in sight besides failure.

It just is how it is. What I’ll try to work on:

I’ll allow myself to fail, stutter or mumble when I don’t feel comfortable talking in groups, but I’ll talk nonetheless when I have something to say so that I can practice that which I’m not good at.

Which means I’ll allow myself to feel discomfort. Deep discomfort and shame, which I know, will lessen one day or I’ll get used to the feelings. 

I’ll allow myself to be intimate with people I feel comfortable with. And to warn them when I feel like fleeing and hiding. The right people will understand and won’t give up so easily. 

I’ll accept failure, expect disappointment and revel in misery because I know it will lead me to something better than this dark void I’ve been living in the last years of my life.

"I think I have AvPD (avoidant personality disorder) I have recently come across AvPD and I realized that I relate to almost all of the symptoms. First off, I’m very anxious in almost all social situations. This includes hanging around friends i’ve known for many many years, being around extended family (who i’ve also known for many years), being around coworkers, meeting new people, and even just going grocery shopping. 

I often try to avoid a lot of social situations which has definitely affected a lot of my relationships. I’m not very close with my friends or family anymore. I still hangout with them sometimes but it’s not on a very deep level. I don’t really open myself up to anyone. I’m scared of people figuring out my true personality and that they won’t like me for who I am. I hide lots of parts of my personality and not one person on this earth truly knows me. I’m close enough with my parents that I don’t get anxious around them, however I still hide many pieces of myself and don’t feel comfortable enough to show everything about myself. 

I have also struggled to find jobs that don’t make me anxious. It took me until I was 18 years old until I finally got my first job because of this. I currently work at a daycare and have worked here for about 7 months and my anxiety has seemed to get worse. I have been thinking about quitting for awhile now but am terrified of having the conversation with my boss about quitting. 

Whenever I’m at work, I feel inferior to everyone else. I feel like I have less experience, I overthink everything, and I am so awkward around my coworkers and parents. I feel like I’m incompetent and people don’t take me seriously because of my poor communication skills. My mind often goes blank when I’m asked questions and I don’t feel like I’m much of a help. I also try to focus completely on the kids and I would rather not form any real relationships with other coworkers. I try to keep conversations polite and small. I rarely talk about myself either, just enough to get by. I play it safe. 

I’ve always just felt like there was something wrong with me. Social anxiety kinda describes the way I feel but it seems like it’s more than just that.",Personality disorder

"I look like how I want to. So, this is actually something really positive for me, even if it isn't considered the best thing in everyone's minds. 

I was going to the bathroom, and I was wearing a really baggy hoodie with pants that are way too big for me these days. The pants used to fit me just fine, but I've lost so much weight that I have to tie them around my waist or they'll just fall off. 

Anyways, what I'm getting at is, I saw myself in the mirror when I walked in, and I couldn't help but think that I look exactly how I want to look. I love how comfy clothes look, my hair is long and messy, and I guess I'm in a good enough state of mind to see myself as cute when my hair covers my face like it did. I am embarrassed that as a guy, I like feeling cute, but I think it's great and I've been told that it actually makes me more attractive. 

But when I was admiring myself in the mirror, I lifted up my hoodie (no I don't wear a shirt underneath my hoodies, the temperature much too hot for that as I can barely wear this hoodie) and I saw that my waist was super skinny. Of course, I don't eat much, and I still function fine, so I guess that's okay. 

What I'm getting at is, I was able to look at myself in the mirror today, and I liked what I saw, and people can think what they want, I look exactly how I want to look today, and I love that.

Things have really been getting better for me, and though there's still plenty of low points, I can easily see my condition is getting better.

I asked my mom about it, and she told me to lift up my legs; when I lifted up my leg I felt no pain, so she said I was fine. It doesn't hurt, but it's just a weird pressure feeling. Yesterday it was a constant pressure feeling, but today it's more random. I didn't feel anything until a couple minutes ago. I know appendicitis is very painful, so I don't know if I actually have it, or if my mind is playing tricks on me. I had an anxiety attack over this yesterday, and I'm really scared of having it. also sorry this is kind of a messy post. 
  
This is really annoying Lol. I want to calm myself down, but idk how. Any help is appreciated on how to calm down and focus on anything else. ",Anxiety

"I don't make decisions or have preferences? I don't know if this is AvPD, but It's like I can't make decisions for myself based on what I want, or even if someone needs me to do something I constantly ask for reassurance I'm doing it correctly. If I don't feel totally confident, I'll just sit there and wait till I can ask.

I unironically use dice rolling and stuff to make decisions for me, so I can kind of appear neutral always, almost like a scapegoat? So if people don't like It I can just say I didn't really make the choice.

I just feel so terrified of making the wrong choice all the time. Sorry if wrong place, or if i put it badly, but this has really affected me as far back as I can remember.",Personality disorder

"Possibly losing parenting rights due to bipolar disorder The most recent manic episode I had was after being depressed and diagnosed with major depressive disorder to be prescribed Zoloft. Within 6 weeks I was staying up for 9 days and delusional. I thought my partner was going to kill me so I called 911. The police arrived and I was very agitated and explained my delusions and they took me to the nearest psych ward for an evaluation. Unfortunately, that psych ward didn’t keep me long enough despite my volunteering to stay longer. They also gave me a medication I ended up allergic to which took treatment even longer.

This resulted in asking my in-laws who live in a different state miles away to help me care for my daughter until I found the right medication combination and was stable. I knew it could take a few months and I had no one else available local to me. The only way my inlaws would take my daughter is if I signed over guardianship. I was under the impression it would only be for a year at the most. But honestly, I wasn’t really in the right mind to consent to that paperwork. I just knew I needed help and I did what I could to ensure my daughter had the best care possible while I got stable. 

Fast forward to now my partner and I petitioned the courts to end guardianship as I have been stable for 2 years. I have letters from my therapist and pdoc stating I am in treatment and stable and medication compliant. 

Well, my in-laws are trying to prove I am unfit for things I did while I was manic so they can adopt my daughter without my consent or permission through the courts. They're also trying to prove that my partner (their child) is unfit I am less worried about that. 

My therapist says they're on a witch hunt and that they're just trying to raddle me and no judge would grant them adoption. I hope she's right.

"I'd rather have cancer Then at least there'd be a hope of getting cured and resuming a mostly normal life. If I knew I just needed to push through the next few years of misery, and then it would be over one way or another, then I think I could do it.

No one blames themselves for their kid dying of cancer. People have so much compassion and sympathy for people with cancer. Why is it that the same compassion isn't extended to people with incurable, lifelong, crippling mental illness? Why does someone's pain have to be cosmetically obvious for people to care, or even believe it's real?

I wish I did not have to think this way, I wish my parents let me study what I wanted so I was not such a failure and a disappointment to them. In the beginning of this year, I broke down and told my mother that I could not concentrate on my studies no matter how hard I tried and that I did not think I would be capable to study science in Grade 11 but she did not listen to me.

My goal to be a regular French teacher evolved and now I would absolutely love to become a French teacher in Sweden.But it feels doomed to failure and it is seriously eating me up.Why?

What if I am not good enough? What if students do not like me? What if they make fun of my appearance? Of my stutter?My anxiety sadly comes with scopophobia. I was never able, in school, to stand up and go to the blackboard. I was never able to speak in front of other people. At the end of my second high school year, I had to give a presentation with a girl of my class in front of three unknown teachers. I broke down. The girl, and I thank her wholeheartedly for her kindess and attempt at comfort, had to hug me to calm me down (first time I was hugged or even touched ever since I was ten, when my pet bird died, so this hug really meant a lot to me). Being looked at, or just being noticeable, at best makes me uncomfortable, at worst makes me freak out.How am I supposed to be working as a teacher in those conditions? Am I fucking delusional to consider getting this job?Actually, I thought about working all alone in nature, something like that. Sadly, my academic profile is literature-oriented so I have a hard time finding a formation open to profiles like mine. Places are limited and usually very far from where I live.

But my initial honest reaction was ""I don't even know who I'll be by then."" I didn't say that out loud, but it was a clarifying moment. Does anyone else have this issue? (Probably.)

An added unwanted effect is that this makes me come across as flaky, disorganized, or unreliable -- and I'm not saying I'm definitively NOT those things. Bums me out, though. I can use a calendar app, I swear. I just do not know how I'll be feeling a month from now.

"My Diagnosis is the worst thing to happen to me I was diagnosed a month ago after going in for a [TMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation) consultation for what I thought was my life long clinical depression. The psychiatrist told me I was not a candidate because I was not depressed but had bipolar type 2. I got a second opinion and he also confirmed bipolar type 2. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since I got my diagnosis, I've kinda gone off the deep end. On one side, I got an answer to my problem and a potential solution. But on the other side, I am now unable to see any part of me with any normalcy. Everything about me is now seen with discernment and that is causing me to lose my mind, so to speak. I don't want to call it a mental health crisis, but that's what it feels like.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 27 and have obviously lived with this most of my life, but I always just thought I had depression that I was able to come in and out of depending on my lifestyle choices and I was probably a bit ADHD, loud, laughed too much etc... But now when I'm in a ""good"" mood, I just think I'm hypomanic.

&amp;#x200B;

The doctor gave me a mood stabilizer that caused extremely vivid hallucinations and I was scared to sleep... I would stay up all night just because I knew I would wake up with crazy hallucinations - I saw my girlfriend turn into a wearwolf and bite my neck. CRAZY things like that...

&amp;#x200B;

So now I'm depressed and it's hard for me to work, I keep having meltdowns and I don't know what to do... I'm fearing that this will ruin my career and even though I'm optimistic that I'll eventually find a drug that helps me, I don't know how much time I have to get stable. Why is this happening to me just because I got a diagnosis?

"Went to school today to get a confirmation that I will be dropping out, principal scoffed at my situation. My teacher already told me that it's impossible for me to continue the next semester. I already know that, but she told me it needs to come from the principal itself for confirmation. So we went to him just for the confirmation. Now the principal went on and on about me coming to him begging for a second chance... Which i didn't. I just went there for a confirmation. I already know they're not gonna give me a second chance. I didn't come there to beg.

He then went on about how I don't really have anxiety, because if I do have anxiety, I would have found a way, apparently he knows because he has anxiety too. The thing is, I DON'T HAVE ANXIETY. AVOIDANT PERSONALITY DISORDER IS DIFFERENT FROM ANXIETY.   He then said I'm just making excuses and I just got lazy. 

I'm not asking them for second chances, I know right from the start they are not gonna accept me anymore, but I don't appreciate them making fun of my shitty mental health. That's the thing with this disorder, we literally avoid things to the point where it affects our whole life. 

He was acting like i went to his office crying and kneeling down begging to give me a second chance, he said ""I know why you came here, to ask for a second chance"", when I literally just sat in front on his desk and agreed that they can't give me another chance. I wouldn't have come if I knew he was gonna make fun of my disorder. I only came because my teacher said it needed to come from him for it to be final. Now everyone thinks I'm just making shit up. It also doesn't help that my country doesn't have a GED.

"I've never had an ulcer and can't remember the last time I had acid reflux. Upper stomach pain... brain says cancer, logic says acid reflux or ulcer. Help? Mostly asking what an ulcer really feels like.

 I've never had one before as far as I know (I'm 29) and have never been diagnosed with one. But then again, because of insurance issues, I've not really been able to see a doctor in like. Years. It's ridiculous. Long story. Anyway, I'm hoping to get insurance and be able to at least be seen within the next few months. Until then, though, reassurance is kind of all I can get.

I know what that sharp burning acid reflux feels like, I used to get it sometimes in high school, but generally, I don't ever experience that. I honestly can't remember the last time I got that sickly, burning acid reflux feeling. My diet's really bland out of preference (mostly vegetarian / some, but not a lot of meat) which I think contributes to a lot of my inexperience with acid reflux.

I have pain in my upper abdomen, right in the middle. I can't tell if I'm feeling it in my esophagus, liver or upper stomach.  It feels very close to the surface and hurts when I push on it. It doesn't really feel like the way acid does when it trickles up into the esophagus. The pain worsens when I have gas and eases up when that passes. It's dull and honestly easy enough to just work through, but the fact that I've been having it almost every day for a couple of weeks now concerns me.

Doesn't hurt to breathe. Just this dull ache ranging from annoying to actually kind of ouch, but still not enough to vocalise about. Just concerning because it keeps happening.

I used to drink a couple beers every night but now have since eliminated that to see if it makes a difference (I can't tell if it helps. Feels the same as when I drank every night.) 

Is it possible that this is just acid reflux and that it can feel different from the hot burning feeling in the heart area?

Does this sound more like an ulcer?

For what it's worth, I think I'm in fairly good health—just underweight (95lbs, 5'4"", Female) with no family history of cancer (but I recently learned I have a family history of gall bladder problems.) Mildly sedentary activity levels (work a desk job and tend to spend a lot of time writing at my computer while at home.)

"I’ve only just realised how badly stressed I am but I don’t know what to do, no one will take me seriously I, 20F, have a few things that just seem off to me. I have a job that I hate, it’s my first job, it’s a 9-5 in a high pace high stress environment and when I make a mistake it has an effect - and of course I do make mistakes. My coworker also treats me like a personal assistant and delegates all of her last minute jobs to do immediately without thanks which is so stressful as I can never complete a project on time because of it. Enough backstory though this isn’t a life advice sub I just need to rant about the things I think are caused by stress?

I’ve always looked young for my age, I take good care of my skin using retinol and SPF 50 every day yet my skin is ageing (I turned 20 a month ago so this is weird). I look heavier than I am, I get a lot of exercise (10K steps minimum daily plus cardio focussed gym 2-5 times a week depending how tired i am) and do not over eat, if anything (tw) I probably under eat by a long way because I lose my appetite and forget to eat. It’s just bizarre to me and it’s not that I want to be thinner but I know that with my lifestyle I ought to be a lot thinner than I am so I’ve no clue what the reasoning for that is. My psoriasis is getting worse. It used to be a small patch on my leg but now I’ve got it on my lips, cheeks, back and it’s spreading down my arm. I was researching self soothing and I do that obsessively, I bite my lips to oblivion and crack my knuckles to the point where they hurt. I am ALWAYS tired even if I get 14 hours of sleep, luckily my insomnia has gone away for the time being but that used to be really bad too. I also get migraines the second I begin to relax. If it’s not pretty obvious ill just throw in that I have been diagnosed with anxiety. My doctor doesn’t want to help and there’s no free therapy in my area as there’s massive wait lists for everything. So I’m on here hoping to find someone who might relate. Can this all be due to stress? Do you have any advice? My job contract ends soon and I’m not renewing it don’t worry but I know any entry level job will be just as intense so how can I manage it and minimise these symptoms?

"Travel Tips? How do you handle barking security agents, boarding passes, changing itinerary, foreign languages, rude locals, etc. without losing it? Here's what's worked for me:

Photograph \*everything\* important - passports, credit cards, boarding passes, luggage, and store the photos in a locked folder on your phone. This helps recovery of lost items, lower your footprint if you get robbed, and it creates backups because you never know.

Try to research as much ahead of time - Rick Steves advises to book the important stuff, but keep things open ended. I've found, since I'm so easily distracted, to have a few good options at all times that you can do in case things are getting weird. 

Go easy on the coffee - first thing I want to do in an airport or a new city is to have coffee. There's downtime, I'm jetlagged, weary, and already overstimulated, and caffeine I think adds to my disorganization. If I get lost, it makes me look even more like a crackhead asking for directions. It's best to get acclimated then act like a local.

Assume you will get lost and account for it - my sense of directions are terrible. Without google maps, I would be at the front of Walmart, aged progressed, with a slightly insulting cash reward for whoever finds me. Set up SIM cards, initial itinerary, and a basic plan to get settled after arrival. 

Breathe, dammit! - everything's new, everything's stimulating, but you have responsibilities. Stay present and take.your.meds. Do you really want to be hospitalized overseas?

"I need help. In a bad state. I’ve never posted on Reddit before, but here it goes: I’m 31, female, and I have been suffering (and I mean suffering) from what I am reluctant to label health anxiety. I have suffered from anxiety, panic, and depression since I was 19. I have also had severe stomach problems since I was probably about 10 years old. For the last, I would say, 4 months of 2018, I had intensifying acid reflux. I avidly practice yoga, and it got to the point that I couldn’t do down dog without bile coming back up my throat. Christmas night, I suffered a panic attack out of the blue...and somewhere around that time (I can’t recall exactly when) I must have googled that symptom (severe acid reflux) and ended up at the conclusion that I have stomach cancer or pancreatic cancer. I have rather honed in on pancreatic. In the weeks following this, I have completely lost my appetite. I’ve dropped about 10-15 pounds.   I have horrible dry mouth, pains in my abdomen and back, sporadic diarrhea (when I actually can eat anything) I cannot work, be a mother, or give my attention to anything that isn’t focused on my impending demise. I have obsessively written down my theories about what I think I have, my symptoms and what’s causing them. I feel as if I can feel the cancer in my body. I’ve even researched how to tell my child that I have cancer bc I want to be prepared. I endlessly google and search YouTube videos.

"I think my mom found the explicit photos on my phone and I feel like throwing up. So ive been masturbating for a few years and i started saving videos/photos to my phone so its easier to get to.

The latest notification was 2 hours before I woke up, so I was certain my phone was turned on. 

The photos themselves were just photos and videos of girls I thought were really attractive (they were over 18) and would use to get off to. 

Now since they are in the recently deleted tab, notifications were only 2 hours old (and I had notifications from before 2 hours ago but before I went to sleep), I had apps open which I never use, and my phone wasnt in the spot I last had it.

"My fingernails are giving me so much anxiety!!! I have not been this anxious for so long. I've dealt with health anxiety in the past about many different things that seem so much more serious and like more confronting (for me) like stroke and heart disease since those are two things that have been in my family. But within the past two weeks I have been incredibly anxious about my fingernails because my two thumb nails have ridges in them, almost like lumps. Of course I googled, I know, I shouldn't. I did though, and it was filled with kidney disease and all these terrible things and now I am unbelievably anxious. My therapist cut us back from weekly to fortnightly visits and now to monthly and my appointment got delayed for another two weeks even though it's been a whole month. I don't feel like I want to share this anxiety to him because I am embarrassed. I feel silly that I am so anxious and paranoid about my fingernails, but the reality is that I can't stop thinking about it even when I'm not directly thinking about it. I'm constantly checking google to see if I can find something that maybe says it's ok and it's nothing to worry about but I can't and it's making it worse. Ahhh",Anxiety
Treatment for bipolar depression Ive been diagnosed with bipolar. I struggle with psychosis primarily in the form of delusions. They tell me this is mania even though i dont experience the typical symptoms like endless energy. Well ive been put on a latuda (an antipsychotic) and depercote to combat the delusions. My problem is im horridly depressed now. I spoke to my doctor about what we can do for depression and he said whatever treatment we pick its going to be a long time till it works. My question is what treatments have been effective for managing your bipolar depression? This is a long battle thats starting to feel unsurmountable. Any input would be greatly appreciated. ,Bipolar
"Rose-tinted glasses or blue? If 20/20 vision of life is what you want, choose the blues, according to two psychologists whose recent study concludes that depressed people have a more accurate view of reality than non-depressed people.""It is ironic,"" says Lauren B. Alloy, associate professor of psychology at Northwestern University, ""but folks who tend to be normal and positive tend to see reality slightly askew."" And those who are depressed, alas, are ""sadder but wiser.""The study, the latest in 10 years of testing theories of depression conducted with Lyn Abramson, associate professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, examined emotional reactions to mid-term grades among 144 students, most of whom had been assessed as mildly to severely depressed, having experienced symptoms that ranged from saddness and lethargy to sleeplessness and interrupted appetite to thoughts of suicide.Alloy says the results challenge established theories that depressed people suffer a ""learned helplessness"" from the erroneous belief that they have no control over their lives, and that depressives not only see things negatively but actively distort reality in a negative way.""Instead, the depressed students were very accurate in judging their degree of control over events,"" reports Alloy. ""It was the non-depressed students who made the systematic errors in grossly over-estimating their control when the event had a good outcome {when they actually} had no control over it. And non-depressants underestimated their control when the event had a negative outcome.""Alloy and Abramson found that people suffering the doldrums proved most accurate in making judgments about themselves and less keen at sizing up other people, whom they saw in unrealistically optimistic terms -- just the opposite of how normal people see things.""It appears depressed people might be suffering from an absence of the positive bias and illusions that normal and nondepressed people tend to have,"" says Alloy. ""They have lost the capacity for distorting reality in a positive direction.""It seems to be more healthy, the researchers found, to have a slightly positive view of reality, even if its slightly distorted.

"The urge to disappear and start over.  

First I want to say that I am not diagnosed. I've seen quite a lot of posts about this urge to disappear on [r/Schizoid](https://www.reddit.com/r/Schizoid/) and also [r/AvPD](https://www.reddit.com/r/AvPD/).

I am kind of glad that I am not the only one who does this. I constantly delete my social media and start over. By doing this I also ghost all of my friends on Discord. With social media like Reddit, Twitch and others creating new accounts isn't a problem for me because I don't post anything. I only keep my Steam account. I always knew it's not normal. I didn't know other people also struggle with this.

My friends are annoyed whenever I come up with a new Discord account. I really don't want to talk to them about this. It's hard for me to talk about my feelings with people I know. I feel like they wouldn't understand me and/or would judge me. Most of my friends I've known since 2017. I usually just come up with a dumb excuse like ""I forgot my password"" or something like that.

I want to explain the weird urge I get whenever I feel like disappearing. Under a post there was this comment:

&gt;There was a point where I realized I was getting very good at starting things because after a certain point I would get that urge to restart. Not just with accounts, but with everything. I'd plan out how I was going to use an account, build a new habit, accomplish some goal as efficiently and optimally as possible, and for a while follow through. Eventually I would drift off track a little, let it eat at me, and then give up and decide I'll start over and do it better. At this point I struggle to get to the ""I'm going to try"" stage and usually just don't bother. The apathy does help me push through failure or perceived shortcomings a little more.

This comment describes my situation very accurately. I feel almost exactly as this guy.

Creating new accounts has become a routine. I feel like it even calms me and is the closest thing to running away from everything. It's kind of hard to explain how I feel..

I ghosted my friends like 3 weeks ago. Throughout the weeks I've tried to start over, but I always fail and just start over once again.. I didn't tell anyone I'll disappear. I deleted my Discord and now I'm gone. My friend texted me on Snapchat asking why I deleted my account. I just responded with something like ""yeah lol"". Didn't even give an answer. Ever since then I haven't talked to them. I want to, but I know I'm gonna disappear after a month. I also don't want to explain to them why I deleted my account because I can't even do it right now where I am anonymous.

Probably a lot of mistakes, very unorganized post but yeah.. I hate this. I just want to be normal. :/",Personality disorder

anyway. i was heading out for my break on saturday, and i got my marlboros out of my locker.

 i don't really know what was different this time. it must have been a beneficial glitch, because i haven't shown that degree of spontaneity since, especially not while 100% sober.

"Feel like a piece of shit I (23F) don’t know how to explain myself to the people closest to me. When they look at me they see potential and they figure I should be more independent. I graduated college in December and my family, although they won’t say it to my face, expected me to land an impressive, stable job right out of college but they didn’t realize (and I know this is mostly my fault because I never really opened up to them about it) that my avoidance got progressively worse as I went through college. 

I never made any friends. Not one. Always too self conscious and awkward. I don’t talk to anybody I met in college. I was even on the volleyball team and never got close to any of my teammates over the four whole years. Only kept it amicable and surface level. Always to scared to open up. I grew progressively more lonely as the years went on. I felt a lot of shame about my lack of social life and made sure to never really bring it up around family when I would see them over break. I figured all that mattered was that I get good grades and work hard in volleyball. Besides my social anxiety and depression would be so overwhelming most days, the only thing I felt like I had the energy for was school and sports. I was constantly overwhelmed and didn’t have the energy, desire, or confidence to be social. The worst part was hiding this part of myself from family. Always feeling like I’m constantly hiding. 
I basically just went through the motions in college but that’s honestly all I had the energy for.  It felt impossible to dream up a future, a career, because I was just trying to get by each day. I would always (and still do) feel guilty for wasting my time in college. For passing up dozens of opportunities that were right in front of me because of my avoidance and fear. 

So it’s been three months now that I’ve graduated and I still don’t know what I’m doing with my bachelors degree. I know I’m letting my family down.
I’ve been living in my mom and stepdad’s house since I’ve been out of college and I only recently got a job at a cafe and everyone seems to think I’m selling myself short, doing the bare minimum. The thing is, this job was basically handed to me because my mom is one of the managers and they were desperate for people. I only just started this job and dealing with the customers has been hell. But I thought this would be a good way to finally step out of my comfort zone. Even if I’m not using my degree yet at least I’m earning my own money right? Wrong. It doesn’t feel like enough. I suppose I feel pressure to live up to other people’s expectations of me. But I also honestly know I should be doing more. I should have a license, a social life, an exciting job, more independence—but there’s something wrong with me, something missing. I know I should have more compassion for myself but that’s really hard in the position I find myself in. 

I’m honestly more frustrated with myself than anything. I feel intense shame about my lack of social skills and general fear of people. This simple cafe job even feels like too much for me because of all the interacting with customers, which only fills me with more shame and frustration. If I can’t handle this job then what can I handle? I feel stuck and hopeless. I think I might be looking into a therapist so there’s that.

"TLDR; i tend to isolate and push people around when i got depressed. i want to change that behaviour, so i do not because problem anymore. The final straw is when my academic manager in college say to me that she hate the type of student of me. When i get down, i tend to isolate myself. Always hesitant wether i should reach out and bothering people, or just suck it up because i am worthless anyway. This kind of behaviour because me a lot of troubles and enemys.

"Feeling dreadful after best friend didn't want me to come on night I know this feeling is unjust, but I can't help but feeling dreadfully anxious and sad that my best friend didn't want me at a night on the Weekend. 

I'd been excluded before in this group of friends when they went on holiday last year together. I was really upset then and just so happened to be very down at that time anyway so I ended up bringing it up and we got into a huge fight where he said he hadn't meant to and these things just happened, but also, I needed to back off.

So this weekend, he said he'd got a ticket for this night but downplayed it like it was only him and another guy and not the whole group going. But everyone from that group went. He said he hadn't known they were but I'm sure that's not true and now on reflection, they had probably planned it for months. 

I know I have no right feeling this way, people can do what they want but I can't help but feeling really sad about it, like he didn't want me there for a reason and after last time, I don't want to mention anything because I don't think he'd take it well. I know we should be able to do different things, and I'm not saying otherwise but I know everyone in this group and wonder why he didn't want me there. It's making me feel pretty low.

If I ever died, the people who have known me in life would probably never find out. The only people who would know anything are my co-workers, doctors, and family. They would only find out if my work requested a check on me after not showing up for work for a while. Family would most like be notified through that. Doctors would only find out I was gone once I stop answering calls and showing up for appointments.

"Advice greatly needed (26 year old female) sorry for the long post… I’ve been on anti depressants for about the last 12 years of my life.

Not suicidal or thoughts of harming anyone, but I just did not feel in control of my emotions and I felt like I was gonna lose my mind lol &amp; very depressed. So I got back on lexapro 20 mg &amp; after a few months I started to feel average at best but better than before. August 2022 I started to get brain zaps/dizziness every day for over a month so I went to a new psychiatrist and got back on Zoloft 50 mg to start. I worked my way up to 75mg &amp; started to feel a lottttt better, but in December my dad died and I was extremely close to him so that obviously set me back. I went up to 100 mg around Feb 2023 and have been having issues ever since.

"I am so tired and exhausted every single day. I am 21 (F) living with my toxic family. My father died when I was 18. But I was not close to him. We barely had a relationship. He never really cared about kids. My earliest memory of my childhood is of him getting angry about some random thing and throwing away the food on the table and then hitting my mother. I have seen my mother get beaten up ever since I was a kid. She would hit him back while trying to defend herself. They would threaten to kill each other during fights. Kid me would try desperately to loosen my father's fists clenching my mother's hair. But I was just a small kid with no physical strength so I could not do much except beg and cry for them to stop hurting each other. This was long ago.One day, my grandmother (father's side) died and I guess something triggered within my dad (even tho he was not close to her AT ALL) and he lost his shit. He started behaving erratically. Few weeks later we find out through an office colleague of his that my father had been fired from his work. We had no idea. He used to go to ""work"" everyday in the morning. Turns out he was just pretending. Through this said colleague we got to know more: he had angry outburst at work, spouting weird stuff. After some more strange incidents (not going into details) we got an appointment with a psychiatrist and my dad was later diagnosed with schizophrenia. This was when the domestic abuse hit its peak. He became way more violent. I remember one day he broke my mother nose and she started bleeding. Fast forward to 2-3 years (I have no sense of time really, it all seems like a blur now), he stopped taking his meds, became super submissive, barely said anything. I realised eventually that he was depressed (exhibited all the signs). Things changed. Now my mother became the abuser. She would tell him to die, how useless he was, what a burden he was on us 24*7. She also started hitting him. I tried to stop. My father did not. He would just sit there and let her do it. I have an elder brother too but he had gone for college so I was the only one who had to witness all of this all alone with no help. This lasted for some time until he actually listened to her. He killed himself around a week after my 18th birthday. My mother found his body in the middle of the night.I am glad he is dead. At least, he does not have to suffer anymore. I do not know.But now, years after all of this shit, things somehow seem to have worsened (if that is even possible :/ ). I used it believe that once my father was gone from the picture, things would be better. We could lead a peaceful life. Oh boy was I wrong! My mother's toxicity oozed out. I think I have become the replacement of my father. Everyday it is the same thing. ""I am a useless, worthless piece of shit. A waste of space. How she regrets giving birth to me. How I am a crazy person who need help..."" and more. Manipulation, gaslighting, mental, emotional, physical abuse- you name it, she got it. I have (and still am) faced it all. I try my best to do all the chores and not make her angry but it never matters. She will find something to mock, taunt and insult me. I have no place or privacy to cry. it is shit.I have kept alllll this shit inside of me without a single soul knowing until recently. I told me best friend. Well, not everything but I gave a general overview. But I keep stopping myself from saying anything (about the present times) because it is all so intense and I do not think she would be able to handle all this. Even I cannot. Everyday is the same. I am so fucking exhausted and tired of everything. I wish I could kill myself but I have wayy too much hope to do it. I truly want to live a happier, healthier life because I deserve it. I deserve love and care. But my god, this is difficult. 21 years of trauma and I do not see an end to it. I wish I would cease to exist. Why is killing yourself so hard? I am dead inside. I need help but there is nothing. I have no motivation to do anything. No purpose in life. Sometimes I think I might be depressed but then again I am able to get up, do my chores. I do not know. I have also started seeing signs of trauma during arguments and confrontations and it scares me. Nothing seems to be go right in my life. Everything is a fucked up mess. When will this end? P. S.

"Please help me understand what I went through This is going to be lengthy and ahead of time I want to apologize to anyone this might be sensitive to. It involves an affair and I'm struggling to absolve myself for my part in it and have thought often that I might die of a broken heart over this. I'll begin with the story fully and what I need from all of you is help to see similarities in me that'd make me a BPD sufferer or her or what. I am so mentally screwed up over this that it's been hard to move on. I'm almost 3 months no contact as of right now.

The story begins at work. I worked at a rehab facility in a health field. She was at the orientation for our first day and she said later that I'd caught her eye and she'd hoped to talk to me from the very first time she'd seen me. As I began to see her at work she started casually flirting. Once she needed equipment that'd take blood pressure and I said I only had my POX that does HR and SpO2, she replied ""I want everything"" with a look. As we began to really talk she revealed she had a husband even though she wore no wedding ring. I thought she was beautiful and she was very observant. Later, she said that she noticed me looking at her lips one of the first times we'd spoken. It progressed to innocent things like once I'd said me and a coworker missed her while she'd been off for a week or so. She came up to me later in the shift and excitedly and red in the face said ""you missed me?"" When helping a patient up from bed she'd placed her hand firmly over mine as I held onto his walker. Little flirty things like this intrigued me. I know that I should not have proceeded but I could tell that she was unhappy and I did feel like she was truly deserving of more happiness. She was from Moldova and her husband was Russian. They'd been married for I believe 10 years and had a son who was 5 years old. I began to pursue her a little more and wrote lists of things to do nearby that were fun. Although she'd been in the US for 5 years she'd never been to a movie once in that time. I was so sad and just thought this girl needs to experience the lighter side of life. Finally, one day we exchanged Instagram information and soon began talking on there. She wasn't quick to reveal too much about herself but was definitely initiating conversation frequently. As we began talking it progressed relatively quickly, after a month and a half we were meeting for the first time outside of work. It was around this time that she told me prior to meeting me she'd planned to leave her husband and just be ""alone."" I tried inviting her to a movie but she kept insisting that she wanted to come over to my place. When discussing this she was talking about seating and how we wouldn't be doing anything and all of that. I told her the TV was in my room and all I had in there was my bed. She was kind of trying to say that there could be no contact and all of that. Well, within seconds of shutting the door behind her we were making out. For the entire time she was over we made out. She even shook my bedpost when she got into my bed. I know she would have gone all the way if I'd tried. This is when there were things she finally said that shook me a little. She told me she broke up with one guy because he didn't kiss good and stuff like that. She told me eventually that people when she worked at Amazon offered a threesome with her. I have no idea how that conversation even began. She began to sound almost manic with the things she'd say as if I'd freed some mind that was eager to be free. She told me once that she wasn't ready to date older men because she wasn't ready for that. When we ate tacos for the first time she said she was ready to date because I joked that all women like tacos and margs on their dating profiles. She told me there were times she thought she loved her husband. It was largely like a business relationship where they occupied separate parts of the house and just worked together for the practical purposes of a relationship (kids, home, money). She even told me he had cameras inside the house that he'd watch and monitor. As I started to become more attached to her I became more nervous and more fearful. It was at this time she made a reference to the effect of me being her favorite person and something along the lines of she'd let anyone go before letting me go (meaning friends etc.)  The situation to me as it began was that this girl was wonderful and I'd have been a fool to let her life go by without joy and happiness. She truly was to me someone very special. One of the first things she texted me on instagram was that she perceived me to be ""less happy than I appeared"" at work. She just seemed so genuine to me but as time went on I feared that maybe I couldn't trust her. She revealed a lot about her childhood but not much about the emotions she felt. Like, I know she had a tumultuous upbringing. She literally lived in a village with a bed that was above a wooden stove that heated it beneath. I know her dad whipped her and her brother. She was unfairly responsible for a lot as a kid. She also revealed she had a bout of bulimia in high school. She told me they were told more often that they did something wrong rather than be congratulated for good work. She didn't like me complimenting her too much. She would try to change the subject if I'd say much to that effect. She didn't like when I gave her positive reinforcement either. Like, if I said I appreciated something she'd say I was trying to train her. One thing I'd said I appreciate was when she sent photos of home. Like, what she was doing or what her son and her were doing. I just liked feeling as if I was included in her life. I spoiled the hell out of her. I brought her food and everything I could each time we worked together (about once a week). What happened though eventually was we had a night together finally a month or so after our first kiss. I did not perform well. The anxiety of it all and the feeling that I was being told when and if things are going to happen. This wasn't like I'm feeling horny and you are right next to me. This was I'm coming over this day and we're going to get it on. I'm 33 and my sex drive isn't quite that great and add in this whole complicated situation and well, it didn't go well. This was the first time she said ""I love you"" though when we were doing other things in bed together. I became nervous about my failure to perform. I didn't discuss with her the reason or anything regarding it so that was likely my mistake. The next time we saw each other and I said I love you, she said ""can we not say I love you so much."" That shook me because I didn't know what it meant, like holidays? lol I told her to not tell me how to love her and she accepted that although it probably bred contempt. Fast forward a couple weeks and we are in the car after work and I saw her getting close to another coworker at work. This coworker later said he felt ""some vibes"" from her too but once he saw we'd become close he didn't think any more of it. When I saw them two close, I asked her about it. She said ""you doubt my feelings for you?"" She got upset and rightfully so, later that day she was very panicked and called to say that she was shook up by it. Now our birthdays are approaching. I'd thought we'd see each other on my birthday. No we didn't. Then her birthday was the day after mine. Didn't see each other that day either. Then another 5 days or so went by and she didn't come over or anything. Just prior to what happened next she sent me the music video for ""Wicked Game."" Paranoia took over me and I just asked after a day where communication was kind of lacking between us if she was distancing herself. She told me that no she wasn't distancing herself and that a healthy relationship is two people living separately with separate interests and coming together in the middle to share. Then she said at the time that now she felt worse and that I felt better. Two days later and she called to break up with me and said ""love is not enough."" That was the blackest my life has ever seemed. I had never experienced anything like it. Like I was just floating through a sea of nothingness. The very next day she texted to say ""she still thought of me"" and that she was worried. I just told her that I couldn't help her feel better about her decision to break up at that time. Almost a week went by and she called me. I didn't answer because I figured if it were important she would have called again. Curiosity got the better of me a couple days later and I called her back. She answered and we spoke, she said that she had to become ""better at disappointing me."" She told me it would take some time to get back to normal between us but it didn't take long. She revealed that she'd written in the birthday card she got me (but never gave me) that I made her want to have kids again. She later revealed that she feared and projected that I'd be jealous of the time devoted to our children over me. The fantasies continued and she envisioned us growing old together and that we'd ""rest when we were old."" She is a very hard worker. I've never met anyone so goal oriented in my life. She was truly busy and between her husband not helping her, her son, school and work, she was truly doing it all. I can tell that my persistent need for attention probably bothered her but as I became closer I could no longer act cool. After we got ""back together"" she suggested we go to the movies. I was so happy to finally do something with her outside of work or just spending a night together. Some time to finally bond and enjoy ourselves just sounded great to me. I had a great time and I thought she did too. She said before we went into the movie that she was sorry and that she'd ""never forgive herself"" for what she'd done when she broke up with me. She told me when she'd broken up she stowed away everything I'd given her and deleted our conversation on Instagram. She also revealed that it was a time where she considered going to therapy or doing a virtual session. This was I think one of two times she'd ever say she was sorry to me. I don't remember when it was that she'd said this but it was either before this breakup or somewhere else in the middle of all of this but she said ""I need to love you less."" That's not a good thing to hear. This period was probably the best time of our relationship. She even entrusted me to watch her son while she went to an eye appointment. It was moments like these that I needed where I actually felt valuable to her. I didn't think much of myself outside of opportunities like this. A week or so after our night at the movies she came over again to my place. When she came over this time I performed better but still not well enough. I think I went like 5 minutes and then just lost it for whatever reason. I'm not a very experienced guy and I never really talked about it with her because I thought she'd think less of me. A few more weeks go by and she says that she can no longer spend time with me after work. We'd have like twenty minutes between us after a shift and of course I assumed incorrectly it was because of me. I needed reassurance probably a little too often. I don't know if it was the nature of the relationship, the first breakup, or what it was but I felt on edge. She assured me it wasn't because of me that she didn't want to or couldn't stay after work. She said her husband found a (innocent) picture that I'd given her of me. I knew that a lot of what I'd given her was stowed away so I wondered how only this picture was found. He then deduced that I was a person on her instagram from my photo. She warned me to not text her and that she'd contact me. This went on for a little while successfully until one morning I sent her a couple of messages on Instagram. He was actually online on her instagram and saw the messages where I'd said ""I love you."" She didn't contact me the rest of the day so I knew something was wrong. That night I called her and she answered crying. She said that he'd told her she was a bad mother and all sorts of terrible things. He also messaged me the next day saying ""I hear you are very good friends with my wife, I also want to be friends."" I told her about this and she begged me not to reply and to block him. A few hours later, he had blocked me. She told me he'd even planned to send me pregnancy photos of her. It was truly messed up. This whole situation is, I know. When he blocked me, I wondered why. She told me he was viewing the messages over and over. She told me he was planning to tell his parents and that it would be soon discussed within the family. I never heard much about it after that. My paranoia increased. A few weeks went by and we had some intimate encounters but she still wasn't coming over to spend the night at all. I felt maybe that was due to my inability to really perform but I wasn't sure. After her husband found out though understandably there wasn't as much communication between her and I. Now I waited for her to initiate everything. I waited for phone calls. I waited for texts. One day she texted me precisely before I began work and I said it meant a lot that she did that because it was something she used to do. She told me I was trying to ""train her."" We never had real quality time together. Work was really the best thing we had between the two of us. This is where it all began to break. One day I exchanged just a couple texts with her (even though it was against the rules) and I never received a call. I had a spell of emotions come over me and I got upset I said some rough things, nothing too crazy. The next day we spoke and I said asked her if she was happy. She said if she still calls and I still answer that we're happy. She then began dissecting what I was really asking and she came to the conclusion that I was actually saying that I wasn't happy. I felt our communication was so difficult and we hadn't spent any real quality time together by this time since the movies and our one night together. She told me she ""doesn't do reassurance."" She said she'd have to take time to herself and she'd miss me and stuff but she'd not really be speaking to me. The next week or more I just got texts saying things like ""I miss you"", ""can't talk"", ""good morning."" This went on and on for like I said, over a week. I was getting really affected by it. There I was the other man in this whole thing and I'm wondering how important am I? After all, she has a husband and a life outside of our relationship. She was absolutely my primary partner. I finally got upset and sent her a text that was lengthy and said don't contact me I don't know what is going on, I don't have clarity on anything etc. She must have had my phone number blocked because the next morning I received another ""good morning"" message. So I sent another similar message again. This one was delivered because she didn't say anything at all. I'll admit, I wanted her to fight for our relationship. I wanted her to see how difficult this was for me. I understand that I was wreaking havoc on her life to some extent. I was definitely a hindrance to any stability in her life. Well, after nothing came to me within a couple of days I freaked out. I went back on everything I'd said and apologized profusely and went on and on with a whole bunch of texts and calls. Like a whole bunch. I was so fearful and felt like I was digging myself deeper and deeper into a hole that I'd been responsible for. I still felt I was owed some clarity on her stance with her husband and what was happening behind the scenes but I knew that I was screwing up. After all of this she said it was toxic and that I was frightening her. After she said that I lost it. I was supposed to work with her that night and I called off because I couldn't fathom being near her when she'd said I frightened her. Well, that night she was super pissed. She said that I was acting ""like an 18 year old boy not a 33 year old man."" She said there was ""no more us at work, no more spending time together, no more talking"", no more anything. I was shook up by this as I'd been by everything before it. I told her honestly that when I'd called off that my manager knew it was because of some disagreement between her and I. I had known my manager for years and she was a friend, so I didn't think much of it. After she said all of this ""there is no more us"" stuff several more days went by and I decided to resign from the job. She talked to me finally a couple days after the day I resigned. When we spoke she said that her dad never understood her mom and she was fearful because I didn't understand her. At the end of the call I revealed to her that I quit the job. She abruptly hung up on me and later told me that she began to cry after I told her I'd done it because of what she said. She later texted me and said she wanted me to ""let her go."" This where things got really messy. She told me she wanted to ""be single."" I told her I need time to move on. She replied, ""I will not remind you of myself."" I told her she could write a letter if she ever had some clarity on all of this. She replied, ""I will not send a letter, I don't like writing letters."" A few days again went by and I tried reaching out to her. She asked me what I'd done in those few days apart. I told her that I'd done nothing, meaning I hadn't been with anyone else. When we began talking again things got rough, she began trying to lose weight. She asked if it was because I was nervous why I hadn't performed well in bed. I told her that it was but she questioned whether it was her body. She talked about getting breast implants. She told me that the beginning was fantasy and that it'd never be like that again. She once texted me and said that she missed me more than I even knew but that she can't be vulnerable. She said that she needed to learn to love not me. She said so many things during this period that makes me question everything today. I know women can be emotional and I was definitely emotional enough for the both of us but this was next level. After a struggle to see her, she finally said she wanted to see me. When I did I felt just as we always had together. The butterflies and like she was just the most beautiful girl I'd ever laid my eyes on. She allowed me to touch her intimately when we had this meeting but it was almost the last time she'd allow me to do so. What happened in the weeks following was my job was reinstated because my resignation was never given to anyone above my manager. She didn't forward it so that she could protect my employment in case I changed my mind. When we worked together those next few weeks there was some contentiousness between us. One night she was upset because something regarding her parents' immigration wasn't going well. She did not tell me what it was initially. I always wanted to know what was bothering her and I was sensitive to her moods. My life with her felt so microscopic. Each interaction was magnified. Each gesture became what I'd live with for the next week as we spent time apart. I was often visibly disappointed when she would not share what was going on. She was very good at reading my expressions. She stormed off and when I caught up with her she had her pants hiked up really high near this one male nurse we worked with. I thought something of this because she'd said she did that near me initially when we began our little courtship. Later that night I said I wanted her to be happy. That I wanted to have a ""good time."" She asked what I meant by a ""good time."" I said that I wanted to have fun. That we never had any opportunities to just have fun together. It was soon after that I decided to go back to school to better myself and to impress my gf (I guess). When I did so she took one of the classes with me. So we'd have Monday nights together in class. Our job soon closed because the building it was in was no longer going to be serviced. This left us only with our class together. She would never come over ever again to my place after our argument involving work. I did my best each week to spoil her. I made salmon salad that I kept on ice in the car and we'd eat it after class released. I got her a spa package to enjoy so that she could just a take a minute to relax. I really missed her. I really really really missed her. I needed time with her to really bond. Her life was undoubtedly busy but the lack of quality time we had together came off as disinterest to me. I became so attached but so worried about the previous damaged I'd done that I began to spiral. In the class we had a good time initially. There was even one week where he had cancelled class and we had like an hour and a half together. It was great. I felt just happy to finally have uninterrupted time with her. She asked me during that time jokingly if I had brought the salmon salad again for her. Also, I'd gotten her a whole box of candies that she liked since childhood called ""Bounty."" She asked where they were and why I'd not given them to her. She told me she liked seeing my reaction when I was asked things like this. When I told her I hadn't eaten them because I'd had enough sweets. She asked ""who have you been getting sweets with."" I just said a friend of mine (Will). I felt so awkward because she had not been paying much attention to me prior to this night we had together. Texts were more sporadic and often mine that I sent weren't replied to. We still spoke every day pretty much but there was never much to talk about. I craved shared experiences and a sense of security. I'd done my part to ruin things but it felt like this was all being sabotaged. One day I called her after I got out of a therapy session and asked her ""how do I ask for what I need?"" I was being starved. I felt overwhelmed by how much I felt I was being ignored. However, I do know during this time she wasn't caring for herself much either. She was irritated when I asked this of her. One night near the very end I offered her a BetterHelp therapy membership. I told her it was the best thing that I could give her. I had already tried brightening her spirits with the spa gift and the other little things I'd tried to do. She said she didn't want to go and that only she could decide when it was necessary to go. She told me she didn't like how I was trying to change her. Another week near the end, I sat next to her in class like always. After class she asked me why my legs were so far from her legs beneath the table. I certainly felt the push/pull behavior. I know she had a lot on her plate but I was single, I didn't have all of these responsibilities and dramas. I was focused on her. A little too much maybe. I didn't know if she'd done this before?? Why the cameras in the house?? Why the invitation of a threesome?? I didn't know if I was really important. My mind raced and raced. One of the final days we had I asked her in a text ""if I ask to spend more time with her, isn't that something she'd want to do because she loves me."" The next day we spoke on the phone and I asked her to reply to that when she could, she said that I can't ask someone to do that. She'd reply when/if she was ready to do so. I was struggling so much, I have thought at times I might die of a broken heart over this. What finally happened was her son was sick, she told me the day before we had class together that she needed a break and requested that I don't text her. I agreed and the next day we saw each other in class. I broke. I asked her if she'd have any time for us after class, she just shook her head no. I snapped. I began just staring at her, intermittently for a good ten minutes or so. Sulking in the chair next to her, I was probably a real sorry sight to see. She looked to me and said ""we'll talk after class."" I made some passive aggressive remarks about borrowing a pen and stuff but nothing too bad. When we got out of class I was immediately upset. She patronizingly said ""let's have a discussion."" As if I hadn't been trying to have one all along about my needs. I said ""did you talk to your husband today?"" She said, ""I have to, he has my son."" I replied ""well nothing for me then, huh?"" The ""let's have a discussion"" remark made me begin to crack a smile (she did not like that) because I just thought to myself how ridiculous is all of this. I love her, I still do. How on earth could she not see how ridiculous it had all become and how it practically was from the start. The argument went mostly like that for just another minute or so before she began walking away. I followed and she said ""I don't like the way you love. Your love is overwhelming."" She got in the car and as I tried to offer her a water I had brought for her, she said ""I don't want anything from you anymore."" She had headaches a lot and one night she drank and ate the ice from the salmon salad on her way home, that's why I had brought the water for her. She went home and I went to meet up with my one friend. I called her and left a voicemail that said something like ""I wish you the best in all the things you have going on. I hope you learn to love and accept love."" The next day I hadn't yet heard from her and I texted her. When I did she told me that maybe a business relationship is what she needs. She can't handle arguments in love. She told me she went home had a few drinks and considered her husband's proposal to get back together. By that she meant they had sex. She told me that what we had wasn't special, that ""it was in my head."" One thing she asked was why I smiled. I said, ""I couldn't believe I was being treated like this."" She replied, ""you're saying I'm a bad partner."" I said, ""I've been asking you for weeks to see you."" I just couldn't believe the whole thing. She acts concerned about such a thing after admitting to having sex with her husband. Her mind truly was chaotic. Where was she when I was breaking at the seams over our lack of time together. We have not communicated at all since that night. The last thing I sent was one heart emoji. I had no words from her to say anything about what I meant. Nothing. I have cried so much over the last few months. I think often about the day that I die and if I might be able to call her and see her one last time so that we might be able to imagine what it might have been if we'd had a chance. A real chance. I don't know. I blame myself. I know that I might have a problem. Maybe we both have a problem. I don't know anything anymore. It was real to me. Maybe I was just being used? If I could go back I would have stopped it from progressing as far as it did. I felt my confidence and my security change once it advanced. I don't know what does this mean to you guys on here? I've read a lot of BPD, NARC stuff. Youtube, Reddit, you name it. Do I have a problem? Is how I acted, aside from beginning this affair in the first place, that outlandish? Why didn't she understand how I might feel being in my position? Was this just a natural breakdown of an affair? Did I really mean nothing? How do I move on from this? How was this a genuine relationship with none of the healthy aspects a relationship has. Is it because she has a different outlook on love culturally? Is it because she sabotages relationships. I can't see how any intimate relationship with her could succeed, there doesn't seem to be any consistency. I am so confused. Thank you to anyone who reads and dissects this whole thing.

B: jump to a conclusion that you are probably dying and seek medical advise.

Guess what I did. After the doctor listened to my heart and lungs and said it sounds fine but we'll Do some blood work as I hadn't had any in a while and an ECG just to be sure. So I spent all Christmas worrying that I'm dying of a serious lung or heart problem and today the day finally came for the blood test and ECG. Now even the thought of blood work makes me feel sick.

 I layed on the bed and had the ECG done and when it came to the blood test she stuck the needle in and I had a panic attack and she couldn't get the blood from me. I am so embarrassed and ashamed of myself I can't remember feeling any lower. I tried to hard and iv been worrying about this whole thing for quite a while.

"I was diagnosed with it early in life, but I have always dealt with it. Just as I have gotten a bit older, it seems to have become a more constant, more permanent fixture to my existence.In the past, you could maybe attribute it to this or that, like bad luck or even substance abuse. Or even the loss of friends and/or family or other traumatic events, but I am years-past such events and I have better habits now. Plus, out of sheer necessity, I kind of remobilized myself and even got an excellent job again at the start of the year. Something I am good at, that I can do well. So, I cannot really ""work on"" those aspects anymore. I am legit in all that again. it is like I made it somewhere, but it changed nothing internally.But things I do, none of it changes my utter lack of feeling. My total disinterest in life. No matter the changes I make, things that would be considered (and are) positive, do nothing to elevate my mood and general outlook on life. Whether I am in elite physical condition again or not, or earning good money or not, none of it really helps. It feels really nice to be able to buy something for someone I care about, but every time I get paid, it almost all just goes to my savings. Like, I just have no real motivation or ambition. it is like a burnout or something, like just being so worn out from carrying great responsibility at times, for so long.I honestly cannot think of much to buy, that I really want. One of the last holdouts was video-games. I have always enjoyed them but lately, I do not really even feel motivated to do gaming of my own. Then the other day, a really sweet coworker of mine gave me a really nice compliment, but I just kind of smiled and felt kind of sad about it, for some reason. Like, I felt like it was wasted on me and that she would be better off devoting that energy to someone else.And yeah, I do have unhealthy, self-destructive thoughts that, at times, seem comforting. I try not to indulge them. it is all fairly dysfunctional at times. I disappoint myself here.It sucks too because I cannot give up. There is not one person on this Earth to whom I can run for support. everyone is gone, moved on, or I just blew it with them and they do not want anything to do with me. So, if I do not earn a check, I have nothing. I must continue and it is all just bleak at times, since I would really wish just to go somewhere far away, somewhere dark and isolated. Like a sanctuary for despair, which I hate to say.it is just a reality of my life and it kind of sucks that I have not been able to move past it much, despite accomplishing some great things recently. Rather, it seems more a part of me, more certainly, than before. Anyway, sorry for the wall of text. Just I would been carrying these thoughts for sometime now.

"Asked my parents (who I don't live with) for an extra 10 or so a week spending money and they've turned it into a big thing I am currently under an intense care plan as an outpatient at a mental health hospital. One of the nurses suggested asking for an extra amount of allowance. 'well off' (but not rich) parents completely fund me while I'm at university as my loan is less than my rent.

I was debating asking for weeks, me and my parents have had a strained relationship in the past to say the least, some definitely their fault, some a mix of both of our faults. Anyway, it's left a gap between us that I haven't been brave enough to cross.

But last night I asked them, told them I wasn't struggling with the current allowance it would purely be for an extra nice thing a week to help me get by during these times. IMO they've blown it way out of proportion, they wanted a phone call today to log all my spending and now they're wanting to come and visit me TODAY. It's sending my anxiety haywire this is why I don't open up or ask anything from my parents.

What do I do? Say no to them visiting all together? I'm 100% fine with keeping the current allowance, I just want a yes or a no to have some closure on this conversation with my parents.

"During work, a random stranger came up to me and told me everything is going to be alright... And I burst into tears... I'm a (22 female) and my job is reporting and introducing new stores and foods on TV. It's creative and fun but because of the unstable income my mother doesn't support me.

I knew that from the beginning but hoping to please and attempt to make her proud of my accomplishments she would just say ""Why do I need to say I'm proud of you? You have to be proud of yourself""  It's been an ongoing toxic loop so I always distance myself or not contact her, however since last week she's been living with me and we have been bickering here and there. I don't let that get in the way with work though.


Anyway. Today this random stranger during my break time came up to me and looked directly into my eyes and said

 ""You don't need to push yourself. It's okay.""

She kept holding my shoulders and gently rubbing them and I have no clue if this is hypnosis

 ""I know you have some family troubles right now but I can see there are good people behind you. Really good people""

And little by little the weight in my shoulders started to get lighter. And it felt fuzzy. I had this feeling why does she know my family? Can she read me? Am I readable? Is my aura out? I'm about to panic! Then I just burst into tears and had to control myself to do the next reporting.

It was such a confusing experience because she was smiley nice in her 50s lady. 

Can someone tell me if she was a hypnotist or if she can see my soul or some angels or if she was just an empath that knew I was extremely stressed and wanted to let me know I was stressed. Because later She was motioning to her friend her shoulders like letting her know my shoulders were super tight or scrunched up.

"Lack of opinion and interest in things Anyone else ever feel slow to catch on to things? New show comes out, new game comes out, new trend, im always late to it all. I always find myself saying the phrase “that’s a thing?” when people bring up things I genuinely never heard of but apparently everyone else has

I seem to have a general lack of interest in exploring anything in my life. If 0 is “I hate it” and 10 is “I love this and will skip sleep to do it”, the highest I can get is like a 7. Even with the things I “love”. Which sucks. Because often times people bond thru shared hobbies but you have to be passionate enough about that said hobby to actually fit in. And often times I’m just not that into it as the people around me. 

One simple example is when I tried playing DnD. It just made me uncomfortable because everyone was so into it and I wanted to be as well, but idk it felt like there was this barrier between me and having fun. And I get that it might not be my cup of tea, but like, this happens with everything I try

Or when I was considering my major for school. I ended up picking something that I had just ""heard"" was a highly paid major, without really thinking about it at all. I didn't bother to look into what classes I would be taking, what jobs it would train me for, hell, whether or not I even liked it. It was just ""ok, sounds good"". One of the most important decisions of my life, made in 10 minutes. And now senior year, I'm regretting it heavily and feel like switching to another career.

And I'm here again I don't have much time too choose a major and to go back to college, my parents have told me this is my last opportunity and limit time, but I'm not sure if they would actually follow this through. I don't think they would but I could be wrong. 

All my interests and passions are related to social things, social justice, oppressed populations, people's potential. I have a big desire to help people and I'm interested in social causes and. On my very top are things like social work, sociology, and law

But I'm very afraid of the challenging aspects of my personality and how contrary are to the abilities I need to have for these fields. I don't want to be an incompetent professional because of my characteristics and disorder. I'm extremely afraid of having to leave college again, or not being able to succeed.

And I know that there are different ways to work in these fields. not necesarilly having the most direct contact with people. But I want to have direct contact too. I had an experience in my previous major where I interviewed a person in treatment process after they finished their sentence. And I felt so passionate while doing it and I liked so much interviewing him, analyzing their protective and risk factors, to later make a treatment plan (closest experience to social work)

I also worry that if I go to therapy and solve these issues, maybe I will end up realizing that I can't stand naturally (and in a healthy way) working for long periods of time with people

"I got heavily exposed to some really toxic mold about five years ago while working as a scuba instructor. There was a thin layer of it on the interior of my scuba regulator and I was breathing off of that regulator for about 4 hours a day for 2 months underwater and as a result of that my mental health totally collapsed in about 7 weeks flat Once I had figured out what was going on it was too late I had been severely poisoned I have been trying to get my mental health back ever since A couple of years ago I developed sudden onset severe debilitating tinnitus, with my hearing test coming back as normal. Every time I talk to a doctor about this one of two things happens and they either say that is impossible and kill the issue or they do not know how to help or who to refer me to and kill the issue I have done a lot of my own research and have had some success controlling symptoms with various supplements but I need back up on this and there just is none. I have tried bringing what I have done and the limited success that I have had to my health care providers attention on multiple occasions and they have nothing worthwhile to say Its always they do not know what to do and do not know who to refer me to and then the issue dies once again The research and the understanding just is not there yet for this kind of issue To date my health insurer refuses to acknowledge or entertain this issue. And insists all symptoms are mental health related only but also refuse to provide adequate testing to prove otherwise yes or no.I was recently able to push for a head MRI and it showed something interesting in that it showed/flagged for chronic paranasal sinus disease. This was interesting since previously my health insurer refused to authorize any test that would show such a condition and obviously what the MRI technician saw on the MRI was bad enough that it warranted calling the inflammation chronic with no other scan to compare it to. I do not have a clogged or stuffed nose. It is looking like I may have had/do have a phantom cyclical fungal infection in my sinuses for half a decade now that is causing my tinnitus and mental health problems. I asked my health insurer for a CT scan to see the extent of the problem and a biopsy culture to see what is causing the problem, both were immediately denied. I am currently fighting them on that. What is the point on giving someone an MRI if you plan on just ignoring the results?... If a CT scan and a biopsy culture shows a chronic fungal infection that is causing the inflammation, my tinnitus and my mental health problems might be treatable with the right combination of antifungals and steroids to treat the infection and bring down the inflammation. They are refusing to provide treatment by not providing the testing to see what treatment would help.I have been currently experience long term passive suicidal and or mutilation impulse on a near daily bases as a result of my current situation for seemingly no other reason. My health insurer is well aware of this and are celebrating since they finally provided a single individual therapy session and they feel that a single therapy session a month is adequate treatment for the situation that I am currently facing. I have been so destroyed by this situation that I am unemployed living with family and as result of making so little income last year I just switched over to state medi-cal insurance. Since I am now on state insurance my copays are zero and I am pretty sure that I can weaponize the current laws against my health insurer.These days I am passively suicidal on basically a daily basis but not actively suicidal. The current rules state that I am supposed to go to emergency if I am passively suicidal. I do not because I think that it is a waste of my time since there is no treatment there but I think that I might start going. Since, if I start showing up to my health insurers emergency with passive suicidal thought on a regular basis they are required by law to check me in and evaluate me every time but cannot hold me unless I pose an immediate threat to myself or others. This will bill the state a few thousand dollars each time this happens and will only be a time inconvenience to me At what point will the state stand up and take notice? Fifty thousand dollars of the tax payers money wasted, a hundred thousand, five hundred thousand? There has to be a threshold here where they start asking what the hell is going on here. I doubt they will blame the suicidal guy that is just trying not to die by suicide. Then I can leak the story to the media and let the story snowball from there.

"I have struggled with depression for a while but it was not until 3 years ago that I decided to start seeing a therapist about it. Before I went to therapy I really did not know what depression was but could definitely tell something was not right, I was pushing away my friends, was not exactly suicidal but I put myself in a lot of dangerous situations and really did not care about the outcome. Depression for me really comes in waves, I have good months and bad months and therapy has really helped me recognize when a bad month is coming on but this self awareness has almost made me feel worst in a way. I am starting to isolate myself again and I just constantly feel like I am letting my friends down because I am aware I am doing it. I just do not have the motivation to talk to respond to them or hangout with them. It just makes me feel so shitty that I realize what I am doing and I am doing anything to stop it. I realized the other day that I had not once checked up on a friend who was going through a breakup. I had not even asked her if she was doing okay. I just wish I could get better.

"How do you contact your p-doc outside of appointments? Hey all, posting under alt throwaway for reasons.

I recently had a pdoc retire which meant dealing with the lovely process of finding a new one. It took months and was all around bad. So I finally started seeing this new doc and things are looking better...

Except last week I started getting some side effects from a meds tweak we had agreed on. I wanted to register my experiences with the doctor before they got lost to my utterly fractured memory.

Let me note that over the past decade-plus I have worked with six other pdocs and every single one of them offered two direct contact channels *at least* - a private voicemail box and a private email. They have all been clear that answers were not guaranteed let alone timely, and emergencies always go to 911. Most had a list of on-call staff you could talk to within minutes.

Biggest thing for me is the privacy. Legal implications aside, **I don't want ANYONE reading/listening to the stuff I disclose to my pdoc.**

So here's the kicker. New doc gave me his contact card at initial appointment; so far so good. Dumbass me loses the card. Call receptionist to ask doctor to get in touch, either via email or phone.

I was told that the receptionist is the ""best"" person to email and straight up didn't get an answer to the phone question. Not even a ""we can have the doctor call you when they get a chance.""

On top of this a ton of people are telling me this is MY broken expectations and doctors never give out contact info.

I am so confused, frustrated, angry, and generally miserable about this... And the original side effects are getting worse.

Is my experience really that weird? Or do these people just not have a clue?

"I posted this in r/depression as well, but I figure this would be more appropriate. I always feel like I should not have any real reason to be depressed because I live in a first world country where there is an abudance of opportunity for anything you want. However, I have feelings of self-doubt, pity, anxiety and a general low self-esteem most of the time. I am 23 years old and I hate my life. I graduated in Mechanical Engineering in August 2020 and I still have not found a job in my field. This is partially the reason why my depression is bad. I have never had a girlfriend in my entire life and the last girl I tried to talk to ended up ghosting me. I do not particulary blame them either as it is my fault at the end of the day. I cannot beat the depression no matter how hard I try. I have followed every piece of advice I can take such as exercising, eating well, sleeping 8 hours a day, getting sunlight and I still feel like a piece of shit more and more.I would believe this might have to do with childhood-teenage trauma that I have had. My brother was not the best person in my life, which sucks becasue up to when I was 13 years old, he was amazing and awesome. Afterwards, he would because me a lot of physical abuse and mental abuse. He gave me two black eyes in school which many teachers would question if I was okay at home. I was not but I did not let them know that to protect my brother from receiving a bad reputation. I told my parents, but they did not really do anything about it besides a stern talking to my brother. He left me in -15 temperature one time for a few hours where I was just wandering the neighbourhood (I live fairly far from any store so I did not really have a shelter). The thing that makes it worse is that he has a successful life with a loving wife and amazing friends. It makes me sad that people can harm others and still never receive any karma.The next factor is the amount of bullying I received as a kid from my former friends. Surprisingly the ones who became my bully was my friend. This friend is very charismatic and good at getting friends himself. Due to my shyness and having virtually no backbone, I became a really easy target when we started highschool as he was able to convince other kids to bully me as well. The bullying was not anything crazy, just name-calling and making me look dumb a lot. However, they did this every day and it ended up taking a toll on me. These kids are also super successful now and have great relationships.I realized more in University how pathetic and below average I am to my peers. Everyone else can do things much more easier than I can, have much more talents, and are generally smarter than me. I have extreme social anxiety and I always struggle showing my persoanlity around others. Maybe it is a defense mechanism and I will be betrayed again. (Some Good Will Hunting type of shit lol) If it was not for TV shows and the internet, I would be a lot more depressed than I am now. I honestly believe I am a burden to everyone around me and my parents are making it more clear that they do not want me around since I have not obtained a job in my field and am sorta just coasting in life right now.

❌ Friends with whom I can share my hopes and dreams and who I feel deeply connected with? --&gt; **Not for me!**

❌ Just interact with people without feeling completely nervous and socially awkward? --&gt; **Impossible!**

"AvPD and covid has ruined my dream job. So I've been a nanny for about 10 years now (daycare before that) and one of the best parts of the job was extremely minimal adult interaction. I'd go to work, one of the parents would tell me what I needed to know and then went to work. When they got back in the evening we'd say ""goodnight"" and that was it. 

Since covid, however, at least one of the parents works from home. I currently work for a family with BOTH parents work from home. It's terrible. I jump at every noise that might mean they are coming to ""say hi"" to their kid. I worry so much about where they are, what they think they're hearing when I talk to their baby, my appearance, the way I dress.

Consequently, I went a total 16 days without Lithium for my Bipolar 2.

There were other things too, mostly that she’s been inconsiderate, lying, sneaky and had tried to turn bf and I against each other following an argument of theirs. So after a business week of thought, we broke up with her. She had no reaction, it was almost like everything went as planned.

We let her stay on the condition she gets a job and really keeps up with bills. As you can imagine, containing myself while unmedicated has been one fuckload of a task, but I’ve held my tongue. Got the meds back in me last night, started to feel better this morning and a little more throughout the day. Until a friend came over and told me that she had recently messaged him trying to latch on to him. I got so angry that I was shaking, I ripped apart our storage room and consolidated 30 boxes into ten. I threw a mattress in there and set up a corner all nice. When she got home from work she said how sweet it was and thanked me for creating space for her rather than leaving her to sleep on the couch in our living room.

"I barely drink water because of AVPD At my job, there is only one drinking fountain in the very large floor I work at. So that means it's always crowded. As if that's not bad enough, it's far from my office, which means you have to cross paths with loads of people to get there. For those reasons going for water is always a nightmare of awkwardness and anxiety, and I avoid it as much as possible.

"How to tell the difference between mental disorders and shit life syndrome? I've been trying to answer this question for a while. How do I know what's the cause and what's the effect when it comes to mental state? Am I depressed and suicidal because of how my life turned out to be or am I perceiving life to be more shitty than it is because of underlying mental disorders?  

I have never been to a psychiatrist so I have never been diagnosed, but I've been dealing with OCD since I was 6, I experience a lot of MDD, anxiety, social phobia and ADHD symptoms. I've also been suicidal for more than 6 years at this point. The thing is, most of those things appear so small when put next to 7 figures in the bank account. Most of my issues would immediately disappear. Only then I would be able to do things because I can, not because I have to. I experience what I'd call a ""money induced paralysis"". I talk a bit more explicitly about it in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/v4qq6k/discussion_lack_of_motivation_induced_by_lack_of/) thread.  

It's very unlikely that I'll ever be financially independent and it's unlikely I'll ever find something interesting enough I'd deem worth pursuing for hours on end(AKA passion). Those realizations alone are enough to make me apathetic, procrastinate on all matters and basically give up on life and wait for the right opportunity to kill myself. I'd rather be dead than live a life I don't consider to be worth the effort.  

I've been thinking about seeing a psychiatrist for the past few months but I have my doubts. I procrastinate on making an appointment because it feels like my problems stem from money, it's not like they'll make me rich over there. In fact I'll lose money. That is enough justification for me not to go. I also can't get myself to schedule other appointments (blood tests, physio, dentist) because if my life will remain the same despite improving in some areas, then why bother? I'll kill myself anyway without winning a lottery or without some magical epiphany occurring in my mind.  

I suspect there could be something wrong with my brain, because plenty of other people have lives objectively worse than me, yet they see survival as something of value in and of itself. That could be the result of them being ignorant, me being ungrateful or my brain being disabled. So, how do I know whether my shitty mental state is caused by my views on life, philosophy, bad attitude, being lazy, ungrateful, spoiled, etc. or by some condition beyond my reach? Or perhaps that's how it's supposed to be, because my conclusions are logical and I just can't ignore them?",Anxiety

Hell, even if I'm in the *wrong* now I feel like I'm still a victim.

"(xpost from /r/bipolar)Weird experience with latuda monotherapy? Advice? Throwaway account cause i don't really use reddit, i just needed some advice

I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 about a month ago and started taking latuda about 20 days ago. The initial 20mg dosage gradually killed my (at the time) current hypomanic episode within a week, which was fantastic! I also noticed some, but not all, depressive feelings being held at bay, which was nice, if not quite optimal.

However, I bumped up to 30mg about a week ago, and 2 days after that, I had a psychotic episode until the next morning-I felt incredibly debilitating dissociative symptoms and I felt like my body was acting seperately from my mind in a way that was trying to kill me. I couldnt really talk, and mentally, I felt completely void and couldnt form a coherent thought. (my experience was a lot like that of this blog post: https://blogs.psychcentral.com/bipolar-mom/2012/03/i-had-a-medication-induced-psychotic-episode/). Since I have bp2, mania with that much cognitive and physical impairment isn't really normal for me.

Anyways, after that experience my psychiatrist recommended that I cut back to 20mg latuda (which seemed to help with hypomania to some degree) until the end of the college semester, and we planned to experiment with med cocktails after the summer. With all this in mind, I'd like to have some sort of plan going forward. Is there a safe way I can continue to ramp up my latuda dose (i.e. in conjunction with a stronger antimanic agent like lithium)? Or should I quit latuda and try a different drug entirely?",Bipolar

For example today I was trying to talk about something really important to me with my mother, it meant a lot to me because I don’t normally open up. My mother after hearing this went “mm, okay,” and then went on her phone. We were in the car so I held back tears the entire drive home and when I finally got to my room and cried my eyes out.

This has happened a lot as my mother is not a very emotional person. Whenever I open up I think that maybe she will react nicely but this one was the last straw. The fact that she couldn’t even say anything back to me about this thing was appalling and it broke my heart. 

Another person who is frustrating is my brother. I could listen to him talk about video games for four hours straight and have a great conversation but the moment I mention something I want to talk about he goes on his phone and ignores me.

"I'm relapsing on my past HA, at least right now. [Long post] In October of 2017, I had my first actual panic attack and it was massive. I never figured out where it came from, but I ended up in the ER for fear of a heart attack. Had all the symptoms just about. This occurred about 2-3 more times within a week or two and it got to the point that the doctor got frustrated and told me I was wasting the ERs time and money on potential people who may actually need it and gave me a low amount of Xanax and a referral for a therapist. After then, I had lingering chest pains for seemingly 24/7, so I also went to a cardiologist and did several tests from ecgs/EKGs to wearing a heart monitor for varying times, with one month being the longest. Turns out my heart was 100% healthy and the healthiest he had seen in years, which was surprising considering I was a smoker and drank too much caffeine and drank a bit too much. I still smoke, drink caffeine and drink here and there but I've cut down tremendously since. I was in therapy for 6 months. It mostly involved us talking things through, but we also got to a point where I would try to purposely induce attacks so we could with through them together in order to learn how I can tackle them by myself. Another thing we did that helped was write down my current health fears (biggest one was fearing a brain aneurysm would come at any time because of my constant headaches and ice pick headaches) and I would also write why it was making me scared. Then I would come back for my next visit two weeks later and she'd have me read what I wrote and it always sounded insane but never ever for me to stop being worried entirely, but overtime it got better. I was diagnosed with hypochondria/health illness anxiety. I have since moved to California after being in therapy for 6 months. For whatever reason, it was like a complete 180, from worrying about it all the time to not worrying about it much at all anymore. I would still get some attacks here and there but I always managed them one way or another.

Lately, I've just been more down than usual and I plan on seeing another therapist to try and tackle that, but I think it's partially making the hypochondriac I am come back out. Example: about two nights ago, I was getting ready to take a nap, but I was on my phone for a few, getting settled, propping myself with my right hand/arm on my side. Later, I would wake up and I started gaming a bit after, but I noticed my upper right arm and lower shoulder have sharp pains after moving it a few certain ways. I brushed it off because I figured, ""I probably put too much strain on it when I was on my side before my nap"". Well it's been a few nights now or so and while it hasn't gotten worse, it hasn't gotten better, I think. Fine, whatever. But then I noticed pains in my forearm, closer to my wrist that would come and go slightly. Then I started feeling that later in my right forearm. Today I was pulling weeds and when I got back up, my shins had sharp pains for a few minutes. I was feeling off and light-headed and thought I may be dehydrated because I drank last night and didn't really do a good job keeping myself hydrated then. So I did the worst thing possible - I googled dehydration symptoms. When it becomes ""severe"" and should seek help, etc. Granted this was just all on the same page, but I didn't have to read it. I legit just wasn't sure if it was dehydration and it did more hurt than it helped. I'm feeling better after some water, but now while I'm not constantly Googling anything on the exception to see what the symptoms of dehydration were and effects it could have on the body, I'm fighting that feeling of being worried about the pains I mentioned above. If it was just the shoulder pain, or just the here and there forearm pain or the mild discomfort I feel in my fingers... basically if I just wasn't feeling pain in varying intensities and one or two areas, I could easily reason with myself.

I haven't seen my doctor in a couple months and I'm going to make an appointment in the morning and talk with her about it and see what we can do, as well as probably set up to see another therapist for what I'm assuming to be depression. But I'm feeling myself slipping again and I'm not ready to deal with even a fraction of what I dealt with before.",Anxiety

I kept telling myself ""if I feel this way in 3 months, then I will look into my options to end the pain.""

But if you give up that fight you do not end the pain, you just gift the pain to anyone who has ever loved you.My only advice is do not struggle alone, it makes everything so much harder. Call someone, anyone you know that cares, call a crisis hotline, write an anonymous post, go do something you love, try something new, but especially treat yourself with kindness.

"Doctor is forcing me to come off Depakote because I am a 'woman of childbearing age'. She knows I have an IUD and do not want kids but insists despite my protests. I feel totally enraged and dehumanised. I have recently moved back to the UK (specifically London) after having attended university in the US. This is important because the two countries have different rules regarding prescription medications. It was in the US that I received my bipolar diagnosis and started treatment. When I first moved back my GP was happy to renew all my prescriptions from the US, so I do currently have enough Depakote to last me a few months, but he also referred me to a new psychiatrist. I met with her for the first time yesterday and she said that in the UK, they do not prescribe Depakote to women of childbearing age because it can cause birth defects and she would not be able to keep me on as a patient if I were to continue to take it. I'm on a lot of medications for a multitude of health conditions and it took months of painful trial and error to find a drug for bipolar that didn't give me unbearable side effects and also played nice with my other medications. Finally finding Depakote was the best thing that happened to me. I really don't want to go through the pain of finding a new drug all over again. Especially as I've recently been through some trauma (coming out of an emotionally abusive relationship), and am worried how the instability of coming off and on medications might impact me.   


What makes me the most angry about all of this, is that this would not be an issue if I were a man. I do not want kids and of this I have been certain since I was a child. I have an IUD in place, the most effective form of birth control, and moreover since breaking up with my ex I have only dated women (I'm bisexual) so I don't foresee an unplanned pregnancy occurring in the near future. My psychiatrist knows all of this but apparently at 25 I am too young to know what I want or have agency over my own body and my mental health is less important than the wants of some hypothetical future baby-wanting husband. I feel truly disgusted, like I've been reduced to a walking womb. I desperately wanted to scream at her but I need to hold out at least for one more appointment because I'm almost out of Ritalin (also have ADHD) and she's the only doctor I can get in to see and prescribe it before I run out.  


She was deliberately vague about what the 'rules' are surrounding this and if another psychiatrist would be allowed to prescribe it to me or not. My pharmacist certainly had no issues giving it to me after I said I had an IUD. Has anyone else been through this and know what the rules are? Anyone on here a woman in the UK who has successfully been prescribed Depakote? If anyone has a London (ideally zone 1/2) based psych that does will you message me their name (private sector doc is fine)? I'm really at a loss of what to do but I feel like she's not the right psychiatrist for me long term if she's so rigid about these antiquated, sexist standards. ",Bipolar

"Storytime... Hey, so... I've made some realizations in the shower as I do what most of us do and plan out the conversations I'll be having in two weeks because I know it's going to happen and I need to be ready or I'll just clam up and nothing is going to happen. We've all been there, most of us are still there, let's talk about what I'm thinking about in this little vent sesh. 

Alright, so I was showering, thinking about how akward it's going to be when I tell my friends some secrets. Wow! I know, sharing secrets! It freaking sucks!

So basically, I'm part of a church group, and these people are closer to me than my family because I don't like/trust my family and being around them is stressful. These friends that I hang out with all the time are my safe place and they make me feel...happy really. 

Though I don't share everything, these people are genuine and kind, and they always make me feel safe. It's just that, I am going on a mission trip with them this summer. Going to Africa, and it took them months to convince me to come with them. I still don't like the idea of going, but knowing that I'll be with them the entire time makes me feel much better. Besides, I used to fly a lot so the plane ride will be pretty nostalgic for me.  

So, as part of going on the trip, I have to do a few things. One thing that I have to do is research a topic on one part of the trip and give a presentation to oir team (9 people including me). I trust, love, and feel safe with everyone on this team, and all but one of them have been my closest friends for almost 2 years now. I couldn't ask for better friends. 

Anyways, the presentation I'm giving is in two weeks and I'll be discussing the entertainment part of the trip. Basically, I just have to research what kind of entertainment there is where we're going and make a small (mostly funny) slideshow. It doesn't even have to last 5 minutes, but honestly...this presentation is the least of my anxieties in this mess. 

Another thing that I'm going to have to do is share my testimony. That is essentially a summarized version of your life story. I'll have to talk about my troubles, my past, my family, all of it. And these are my friends, they'll know if I'm holding back. But it scares me so much! Half of them don't actually know I have avpd! They just know that I've been going to therapy for a while and that I started taking medicine. Though, the medicine is kind of iffy really. 

Anyways, I'm super anxious about it, especially since I did something similar last year, but that was at the height of my emotional suppression. This time last year, I was so empty and emotionless. But of course, nobody knew. I was always masking my emotions and faking a smile. I didn't even know I was doing it, and when I gave my testimony for last year's mission, it was incomplete and full of holes. I talked about my lack of friends, but I was blind to the emotional abuse and neglect from my parents and siblings because I had convinced myself that I was just weak and that my pain was normal and even less than what everyone else had to go through. 

But it's not like that, that's not how I should think about my past pain. It took so long for my friends to break my barriers, but they managed to do that and convince me to go to therapy.

 I'm much better now, but I'm also not suppressing my emotions. It was really hard at first because everything just hurt so much and it overwhelmed me. One moment I was putting on a face to fool everyone into thinking I was okay, but as soon as I was behind closed doors, I was hurting myself and cursing the world for letting my life be the way it was. 

The fact that I have to go and tell my friends how I've been feeling over the last year is overwhelming, but I am not allowed to go on this mission unless I share my testimony. It's only fair though, everyone of us is sharing our testimony, no matter how much it hurts, we're going to be here for each other.


If you've actually read this far, I just want to say thank you. You're a special type of person, and whoever is in your life is truly lucky to know someone like you.

"Self-diagnoses, panic attacks, and hope Here's my story. Last summer I convinced myself that I had intestinal parasites and kind of lost it. I finally went to the doctor and it turned out to just be a yeast infection (health anxiety, right?). Well it was a really intense yeast infection. Got it under control after finishing medicine from doctor and then purchasing OTC medicine. 

Then I started noticing that my digestive system was totally out of whack, and was experiencing a constant fatigue and strange stomach aches that would appear out of nowhere in my lower abdomen. The aches would be sharp and burning, I felt like I got a ""hot flash"", and then they would go away after only 1 or 2 minutes and I'd feel fine. 

So I convinced myself I had a stomach ulcer (thanks, WebMD). I conquered my health anxiety once again and returned to the doctor. Up to this point, I've never had any real health issues in my life and pretty much never went to the doctor unless I got sick. (Except that I was diagnosed with high risk HPV, which had recently been clearing up. That's another story). So they do a breath test for H.pylori and take my blood. The blood test shows I have elevated bilirubin and they do an abdominal x-ray and ultrasound. No stomach ulcer. And nothing in the x-ray or ultrasound that indicates something wrong with my organs. 

Around this time I begin having panic attacks because I feel like something is very wrong with me. And then, my skin on my face goes insane. Small red bumps everywhere and flaking off all over and so much redness. I get a prescription cream, and it gets worse. I also get a prescription for a mild anxiety medication. The anxiety medicine makes me feel SO light headed, which triggers more anxiety because I feel light headed when I have a panic attack. 

I started a gluten-free diet because I felt like it matched some of my symptoms. Started taking probiotics every day and my digestive issues have gotten so so much better. I went in for a follow-up blood test that showed my bilirubin levels are now normal. I realized the lightheadedness of my medication was caused by consuming grapefruit. I've finally gotten my skin under control with daily chemical peels and tea tree oil and it's improved a lot, though still nothing like it used to be.  

So I've made a lot of progress. However I still feel very fatigued most days. While gluten-free has definitely helped, and I think I'm getting a better hold on my anxiety, in the back of mind I'm still afraid something is wrong. Can anyone relate? I'm reminding myself that I've made a lot of progress, and I think my initial health scare just triggered this health anxiety that I had never had before. ",Anxiety

"Stability and the fear of “what if” I had a major depressive episode in the winter of last year and it had taken me almost a full year to reach stability again, or maybe for the first time.  It wasn’t until I had this episode that I was treated for bipolar II after a partial hospitalization and a more intense inquiry of my symptoms.  I was prescribed mood stabilizers and an antipsychotic for the first time, and I can truly say I now know what stability feels like.  So much so that I sometimes wonder if I can still identify with others on this sub. 

It’s days like today though that I get the sinking feeling of “what if it’s happening again”.  After a conversation with my mom, she pointed how agitated and combative I was being and I realized over yesterday and today that I’ve been cocky, agitated, and jittery.   I also realized that the weather just turned where I live and all these things are the early signs of a hypomanic episode for me and I can’t help but get hit with the fear of “am I ramping up again? Is it going to happen? What will happen to my job if I have an episode? What does it mean for my treatment if it doesn’t work?”  

I know that I’m most likely fine but the sudden fear just makes me realize that no matter how stable I feel, I always need to keep an eye out for the future.  I don’t think we will ever be free as we need to be ever vigilant for bipolar to rear its ugly head again.",Bipolar

If it’s about a topic I don’t care about, I always zone out or stare at out the window. If it’s about a topic I’m interested in, it’s so hard to wait my turn to talk. I feel so impatient to wait my turn (I can wait but it stresses me out and it’s hard to jump in sometimes). It feels like I’m going to forget what I was going to say or they’ll change the topic before I can talk. And then when I talk, I feel like people don’t really care about what I have to say. My family always talks over me or focus on what the person said before me. They never remember what I say either in the future compared to what my siblings say. It feels like a chore to have conversations, sometimes it’s just easier to stay quiet and fade into the background.

"Hi, so usually i come back to this subreddit when shit hits the fan, and I cannot handle it anymore. I do not really know how to start with these, it is always difficult especially with all the emotion and pain, but I guess I will, start with what is bothering me right now. I had this girlfriend in 2017 and I deeply regret how things ended with her and I, I also regret ending it, because i did it thinking that I had no love for her and that I was only in the relationship for the sex. What I learnt though (this was in early 2018 with therapy) was that I had intrusive thoughts, what had happened was that this thought of not loving her had popped up in my head at some point, and I could not stop thinking about it while in the relationship with her. It was horrible I felt as if I was lying to her throughout the relationship. it is like having a person on your shoulder shouting liar every moment, my only peace was away from her. I saw the only way out was to say ""I do not love you anymore"". I was 19 at the time and so was she, so we were both young, but I hate myself still to this day for doing that and not maybe discussing it first with someone. She was my first love, how we met was pretty magical, we were sitting across from one another and I started to sing one her favourite band songs, and she looked at me and we both began discussing our favourite bands and interests. I knew in that instance that I was attracted to her without a doubt and i think she was as well. The worst part I think about that breakup was that I had no one at varsity to talk to anymore, I was alone with all those thoughts and I started hating the world even more, nearly as much as I hated myself. I think that was the worst moment in my life, worse than anything else. Because I felt like a monster for hurting someone I loved, something I thought I would not do. I wish I could kill myself, I wish I could plunge a knife into my neck and bleed out until i pass out, until I am nothing with no thoughts, just a fucking corpse. Maybe then everything will be calm and I would not have to worry about making mistakes like that again. I am too much of coward anyway, i do not like pain. This all started because of old voice note that might have been her. Funny. Sorry about the violent imagery. I just wanted to talk. Just talking.",Suicidal
"My Workplace Makes Me Anxious So I’m not too sure if this is the correct place to post this or get advice, but I’d just like to hear what people have to say about it. 

I’ve been working at my engineering job for 4 years now. It’s a decent job with VERY good pay and decent hours that work for me. But for the same amount of time it has been the main source of my anxiety. It’s quite a tricky job with a lot of learning involved, and it’s taken me a long time to get to grips with. I’ve made a lot of mistakes in the process and with some parts of the job I still feel anxious about what I’ll have to do or about making mistakes while doing those things. 

The main thing however is the environment, and one particular person in it. We’ll call him Bob (say hello Bob). He used to be my team leader, but stepped back from that role to become team engineer (still a somewhat ranked role in itself but more technical) and is one of the most experienced and gifted guys at the place, having been there for decades at this point. Let me preface by saying a good chunk of the time this guy is ok. 

However, Bob is VERY hotheaded and temperamental, and can be passive aggressive, will openly berate people for innocent mistakes and will make “jokes” about co-workers and their abilities/performance that often seem to have a hint too much opinion behind them (often to the point where you’re not sure when he’s joking and when he isn’t). He takes his job very very seriously, often to the point of some sort of corporate Stockholm syndrome devotion (that may be an exaggeration but you get what I mean). As an example, he’s gone off on one at me before for not working much overtime and he has commitment and that’s why he does loads (implying I don’t pull my weight by not working weekends etc).

His whole demeanour makes me extremely uncomfortable and feel intimidated, because I don’t know when he’s gonna be in one of his bad moods or take issue with something. It’s been joked about before whether we’re gonna get Jekyll or Hyde today. 

About 2 months ago he openly berated (near shouting) in front of the whole team and my manager for misplacing a tool during an audit (which I understand is a bit negligent, but I did find it quickly afterwards), it was embarrassing and made me feel small, especially since that could’ve been handled in a far more professional manner. The other day, he made a comment about my rate of work, rhetorically asking “jokingly” why I can only do 1 of something while he can do a lot more in the same amount of time. Funnily enough he’s done that multiple times in the past and it never fails to make me feel heightened and worthless. I get that I’m a slow worker and not the most skilled, but he makes it out as if I’m lazy and not bothered about my job… I am very much the opposite. I just have less experience and work at a slower pace than most because I worry so much about getting things wrong.

I just don’t find Bob very approachable and that makes it even more difficult because he’s our team engineer, which means sometimes I have to ask him questions. But it’s been very often that he’s responded to questions as if they’re stupid or something I should’ve known already.

What doesn’t help is that for the longest time the team has enabled his behaviour, saying to me “don’t take it personally, it’s just the way he is”. Even recently when another team member was talking to me like crap and I spoke to my manager about it after finally having enough, I mentioned Bob and while he spoke to the other person and she hasn’t bothered me since, he said he wasn’t gonna talk to Bob at this time because it “requires a far more delicate approach”. From what I understand Bob has his own issues, one of them being bad anxiety but it seems like he’s dealing with it in very unhealthy ways.

At this point, I’m just not sure what to do. I don’t feel like I can ask my manager to do something about it because of his Bob might react or what he might do. It’s not like the company would do anything anyway because he’s so good at his job and does a hell of a lot. I could move teams, where the work would be more challenging so I could be Maliki life harder for myself. But if I stay I have to stay in an environment that makes me constantly anxious and seriously affects my mental health, to the point where just leaving my job has crossed my mind in moments of madness.

Any advice or ways to maybe cope with this would be really welcomed. 

TL;DR my job and a person there make me incredibly anxious, and I don’t know what to anymore.",Anxiety
"I hope this makes you feel better Society expects us to have kids, house, nice car and a “successful” career to be “happy”.

We’re brainwashed into following this “dream” right from school and put ourselves through great deal of stress pain and suffering.

Unless you’re born into wealth you have to give your life away and work for someone else’s dream with the tales that one day you will have the same amount of wealth and along the way you’re reminded how far away you are and compare yourself to others that have just that bit more than you.

You sacrifice your life, freedom, health, relationship all for some pocket change and a supposed wealth while others are milking from your sacrifice this making you feel like a failure, feeling like that dream is further and further away.

It’s a mindset you need to teach yourself, a mindset where your head is clear and at every obstacle you need to tell yourself no matter what it is that you’ll be fine because LIFE IS TOO SHORT AND CAN CHANGE IN AN INSTANT and then when your health suffers all of these aspirations and dreams do not matter.

I’ve been incidentally diagnosed with cancer - was very lucky as they’ve cut it out fairly quickly, only 3 nights in hospital, painless procedure. I’ve won a lucky dip with life because it was nothing, but seeing people who care about me being so upset was a horrible experience.

I wanted them to be happy and stop worrying because I’ve never thought much of myself then why would they? Because I am nothing, I am not worth anything, low self esteem, never had any aspirations, goals, only liked cars, wasn’t very social, couldn’t really talk to people and sat in my own head alot.

Showing how much those close to me cared for me made me change. When I lay in hospital my head was clear, didn’t worry about work, buying a house, savings or career. Only my family mattered and that’s how I’ve learned this mindset and began adapting my life around it, got rid of as much finance as I could, paid off my phone, sold the BMW bought a cheap Fiat for cash. Financial freedom helped with not worrying about money. Began saving money for a deposit for my new house in the future.

I keep reminding myself to enjoy the little things in life, going for a walk, going to a gym or even buying something fancy to eat here and there on my weekly shop, going restaurant and getting a carbonara or a new phone case. I’ve started eating healthy and looking after my health. I feel happy, proud of myself and I live week by week.

Of course I am aware I am very lucky and not everyone has the same opportunities in life and do not wish to upset anyone by this post. I hope this helps someone to find their path in life.",Stress

Here are some of the behaviours that make me question whether I lack character or that it's caused by my disease.

\-I have trouble waking up in the morning.

 Each morning I get up at around 12am even though I went to bed on time. I just hit the snooze button over and over.

 I'm on 3,5 grams of zyprexa daily so that might be a contributing factor.

\-Abandoning my schoolwork

 I'm in my last year of college and I have to write a dissertation. The last 2 months however I've spent oversleeping, playing videogames and watching TV. I literally have one thing to do and I can't bring myself to do it. I'm throwing away my future for some quick fixes.

&amp;#x200B;

\-Not sticking to my word

 I've gained some weight (this could also be because of the zyprexa), it's not too bad but it's definitely noticeable. Last week I measured my weight and noticed I'm 8 kilos above my goal weight. So naturally I told myself to stop eating junk food. Well yesterday when I got the chance to order some fried food I instantly went for it. Instead of resisting.

yesterday I went out to have some drinks for the birthday of a friend. The day before I already had too much beers so I said I wasn't gonna drink alcohol. I started the night of with a soft drink but the moment my friend said let's have a beer I instantly caved...

"Contemplating So I've noticed that when I contemplate my inevitable death, I feel strange. I can think about if I die tomorrow, the next day, or amy other time, but when I remind myself that it is virtually impossible for me to live past say 120ish, it feels different.

I think about how nothing I do will ever prevent me from dying, and really, it is the only time I feel so...human. I feel small and frankly insignificant because nothing I ever do will amount to anything in the face of eternity. 

A hundred years after I die, what should I care? I'd be dead, so whatever I do will only matter to others if it even reaches that far. Besides, by that point whatever hopes I had that my actions benefited someone is dead alongside me. 

What I'm getting at is, I'm nothing more than a collection of matter that gets some pointless shot at doing something for myself and the other matter blobs around me. It feels very human to me, that feeling of nigh nothingness. 

That is why I'd consider myself religious, because it's the voice inside that tells me something as pointless as me is seen and cared about, and that the things that I do will matter for the rest of eternity.

 I know it sounds crazy, and people have told me repeatedly that I'm stupid for believing in anything, but what else do I have? I've gotten as close to the edge as I could before, just to see if I would do it. Clearly I didn't, but if I didn't have some hope that my faith is worth it, well, you know. 

Anyways, what I'm getting at is that I'm religious because it makes me feel wanted, like I have a purpose, even if it's not entirely clear to me or anyone else really. 

I hope y'all have good coping mechanisms too, because I can take a good guess at what my life would look like if I didn't have my faith.

And for those of you who were hurt in some way because of someone's religion, I'm truly sorry that you had to go through that. Nobody should have to experience that. And I hope you don't think any less of me for my faith, I wouldn't try to hurt someone just because they disagree with me, and I don't get to choose how you live your life.

At the end of the day, I do sincerely hope y'all are doing okay. ❤️",Personality disorder

"Does anyone else get sore aching legs and body pain from being in a constant state of worry and stress I’ve been super stressed and anxious lately because of a lot of stressors at home plus feeling like I have no one to share them with.

My body has acted out in all kinds of ways over the past few months and I’ve been visiting all doctors where nothing major has been diagnosed but I can’t stop worrying.

"recently diagnosed &amp; very anxious when it comes to meds hey all.

i was recently diagnosed. to sum up my dilemma, my entire life anytime i’ve had a medical problem arise, i’ve always been dismissed as it being “anxiety”. i have a history of unexplained syncope episodes &amp; wacky blood test results but no doctor has ever taken me seriously. perks of being a 22 year old female. i’ve been told to take antidepressants for viral illnesses &amp; the like. so i’ve grown costumed to having a distrust towards doctors or i feel like they just use me for money &amp; don’t listen to me, ya know?

anyway, that’s not why i’m here. i hit rock bottom a few months ago &amp; have been seeing a wonderful therapist who truly advocates for me &amp; gives me a voice. he referred me to a psychologist &amp; we did the whole genesight thing. she wants me to start taking latuda.

i did the whole googling the medicine thing &amp; asked some friends about it, &amp; i have yet to see a good review. i also don’t want to be even more tired than i am now as i’m exhausted 24/7 as is. &amp; im scared meds could impact work or school.

i guess i’m just here asking for validation to ease my anxiety. will meds actually help me? or will i feel miserable? i’m really scared. i’m so hyper aware of my body &amp; i freak out about any minor change, even headaches. but also as the months go on the more i feel wildly reckless &amp; isolated. if i start taking them, &amp; want to get off them, will they forever change me like antidepressants can? i’d rather enjoy my few months of mania no matter how wild it can be vs forever be different..

"SAME TIME ANXIETY I’ve been dealing with some health issues that have left me with no answers so my anxiety has been THROUGH the roof - I’ve been dizzy and exhausted from my anxiety. 

But I’ve noticed my anxiety starts 5am waking me up from my sleep with a knot in my stomach, my heart beating out of my chest and an impending doom feeling…then I lay in bed deep breathing. Once I get out of bed I feel better. My anxiety is still there and then peeks from 12-3pm. Then around 5pm I am like a whole new person…no worries..enjoying my hobbies..eating as if I have no worries anymore. But then the whole process starts again the next day!!

"Making changes in a terrible depression Tw lightly suicidal

This week I have to begin fixing my life. I don’t have a choice in the matter. I will need to see a new psychiatrist, and a new therapist. I need to get a job, I need to eat. I have so much to do to fix myself before I can even start with the basics of life. And worst of all, I have to be honest to heal. I’m not even honest with myself. I just smile and nod to everyone. No one takes me seriously, because I’m always laughing and joking. I can’t turn it off. Like when your parents say ‘keep making that face and it’ll stick that way forever,’ I got my face stuck in a clown mask.

I feel like a shriveled, dehydrated soul. Like a sewer rat crawling out of the soggy drain. I’m horrifically depressed, the worst of my life. And honestly the effort just doesn’t feel worth it. I’d really rather just rot and die. I’m so terrified of all this, I’d prefer to die. But I couldn’t make that choice either. I am trapped on all sides.",Personality disorder
"Hey, i have made some progress mentally since I started taking antidepressants but somehow I still cannot get over this issue, not with pills, not with therapy. Wherever I am, alone or with friends i constantly feel like the ugliest person in the room, i admit I might not be what society considers pretty but I just think this is too much, it does not make sense that I hate how I look so much and i know it is not good for my mental health but I cannot avoid it. I just always feel like I am the ugliest, sometimes I think I should not be allowed to go out and I feel bad for the people that have to see me because I am so ugly. Of course with this comes the issue of feeling like no one will ever like me or want to be with me. I just do not know what to do I have been struggling with this my whole life, I really think it is the thing I need to overcome to finally feel like I can be happy.

"My view on the world and myself has been disturbingly warped since I watched 'Atomic Black Pill' videos. That virtually all Women reserve themselves for the top 10% of Men, practically worshiping them. I am not going to go in too much detail as I already posted about it on Reddit and there is plenty of videos on the subject on YouTube. This newly found perspective absolutely destroyed my mind, self image and will to live. I only see four paths I can take from here on out, all options would create a personal Hell either way. I can let it corrupt my mentality, body and soul and instead of my life being fueled by my now dead aspirations, dreams, love, wonder, faith in a better tomorrow I instead function on pure hate. The hate in my heart will burn hot enough to get me through everyday life and to actually complete goals, reaching all types of success. The hate will overpower my desire to be loved hence surviving without it. This is the route I have been taking the past week and it works surprisingly well, better than any other thing I tried in years. The only thing is, I will lose my sense of self, lose my humanity and over time die inside. I noticed taking this route, I am perceived as the bad guy and people root for my demise which admittedly makes me feel worse. Maybe, the ""Me VS The World"" mentality will make me comfortable being full of spite, at this point it is survival.Another option I can see is to accept defeat and continue living the rest of my life how I do now. Lonely, suffering so much emotional pain and lack of motivation that I can barely get up to brush my teeth. Completely devoid of my old passions like gaming and watching movies which leaves me stranded on the couch, facing the wall most of the day feeling disgusting and depressed. This is the most brutal route and the most sufferable. This is my last resort if the other two options fail. My third option of the three is to kill myself. I tried it once or twice before but always failed, admittedly I was less knowledgeable of suicide techniques back then. Now, I barely have the will to go all the way through with it anymore but my new plan is to start taking illegal drugs like Xanax to numb my pain. I will deliberately get addicted and more numb until I find myself able to take 10 to 30 all at once. I heard this is a peaceful way to pass away, definitely so if you listen to your favorite songs as you overdose.The final option is to do what society expects me to do. Shut up and accept my role as inferior, eventually killing off my bad genes. Accept that since I am average looking I am simply a background character. To just stop fidgeting and whining and getting in the main cast solo shots. Only associate with other background characters and accept I deserve less, get off my high horse like Women has told me. I know people will disagree with my beliefs and maybe dismiss me as playing victim but I am trying my very, absolute best to be as transparent as possible. I seriously do not see any other way and I want help. Try to be understanding, if you think there is something I am missing or there is something else, please, share. If you want to mercilessly bash me, feel free to. If you think I am a whining pussy, go ahead and tell me. Seriously, any third person insight will be extremely helpful and nurturing to my character development.If you want to just down vote and move along or not even acknowledge my existence in the first place, I am comfortable with that, as well. Worst case scenario, I document my struggles and experiences so if I do make that final leap and I am gone, my loved ones will be able to google search my name and they will see these strings of subreddit posts.

"Trouble saying ""I love you"" Just curious about this. I've noticed in myself that while I can say it to my family members, I have trouble saying it to anyone else. I have a few close friends in particular who say it a lot to me and to one another, and I just can't say it back for some reason. And it's not that I don't care about my friends, it's just some mental block in my head I guess. Saying it to parents or siblings feels more ""automatic"" in a way I guess, and is therefore less uncomfortable. Such as ending a phone call with ""love you, bye"" ""love you too, bye"". But outside of that I have trouble with it.

Does anyone else experience this?

"I can't trust my memories I had a pretty extended hypomanic episode in Nov-Dec, and a few weeks into the episode I had a long-awaited pdoc appointment at a specialized mood disorder clinic. I came out of the appointment very upset because the doctor didn't seem to want to help me, didn't seem to get what I was saying, wanted me to stop taking the meds that had pulled me out of a year-long suicidal depression. I hadn't slept more than an hour the night before, so the appointment is a bit of a blur, but I felt betrayed by the system and cried for hours.

I saw the pdoc for a second time today and my impression of her was completely different. Apparently she is not a psycho monster bitch. She clearly wants to help me and has a reasonable approach, even if it's not what I would have chosen.

I also realized that I have gaps in my memory from that time - like I know one of my friends was concerned enough about my state of mind to call my mother - but, for example, I completely don't remember one of my friends coming over and visiting me for several hours. Granted, I was drinking a lot over that period, but not enough to completely forget events. It makes me wonder what else I'm not remembering.

I'm diagnosed BPII but I know that over about 6 weeks I spent way too much money, hardly slept (or sometimes even didn't) for days at a time, and drove so recklessly that I could have been arrested if I had been caught. I just didn't go to work a few times. Also had a few panic attacks. I had some pretty big ideas but I wasn't psychotic, so manic vs. hypomanic? Don't really know, don't really care too much, but I normally consider myself a very grounded and rational person so feeling like I can't trust my memory freaks me the fuck out.

I guess this is more of a vent than anything. It's the first hypomanic episode I've had that can compete with (milder) depressive episodes in terms of negative impact on my life. I don't really know how to come to terms with the fact that I can't trust my memory from that time. Especially because according to friends I seemed pretty lucid, but my judgement was obviously impaired.

Anyway, bipolar sucks.",Bipolar

"Freaking out over HIV So a little over a year ago I was hooking up with this guy. We had unprotected sex (vaginal and anal). I had gotten sick twice with flu like symptoms during the brief few months we hooked up. I also had to get surgery to remove an ovary due to a cyst and they did all the general blood work then and everything looked fine. Fast forward to two weeks ago, I had a swollen lymph node but didn’t feel sick. Ignored it. I woke up this morning to a rash on my breast and I don’t know where it came from. It doesn’t hurt or itch it’s just red. I went to urgent care this morning and she told me I was fine and couldn’t feel my lymphnodes but to come back in three days if the rash doesn’t go away. I had just gotten another general health panel done on my blood a month ago and was told I was completely healthy. Well after doing research I found out that general health panels don’t screen for HIV. So now I’m freaking out. I had the lymphnode, and now the rash and I think I have tongue thrush. Not severe or anything but my tongue definitely looks whiter than usual. I’m going to get tested this week but I’m so fucking scared.

"I am going to share with you something that has always cheered me up and calmed me down whenever I get really anxious over my health So this sub only seems to really have posts from users describing their symptoms and trying to get diagnosed on Reddit, now if that helps you with your anxiety that's cool, however it can be counter intuitive as the whole googling and obsessing over symptoms is the actual problem we all came here to rid ourselves in the first place. So I honestly do believe we should move more away from ""I have x,y,z symptoms am I going to die?"" to ""How can I find peace of mind and stop googling"" 


One thing I do to get peace of mind is watch this episode of [Hey Arnold](https://www.wco.tv/hey-arnold-season-2-episode-5-monkey-business-2) which is my all time favourite show (it's only the first episode in the video provided called 'monkey business' btw), I won't ruin it for you all, but it's really funny and will hit home for all of us, it highlights how silly we can be sometimes when we think we have a really bad illness and start obsessing over symptoms.

Someone I really care about is tackling bipolar disorder without medication due to the expense of a psychiatrist. He’s finally in a place where he can get one but with a long waitlist in his area it’s difficult. 

It’s so hard to watch. It’s like I’m looking in a mirror and just seeing myself 3 years ago when I was at the height of my illness. The lashing out, volatile nature, hopelessness he feels hurts me horribly because I know from experience there is nothing I can do. He’s either ignoring me or can’t leave me alone, and I don’t blame that on him whatsoever. Every time he hurts my feelings rn I have to remind myself that 3 years ago I was the same way. 

It just sucks so much to watch someone you care about go through something like this knowing there is so little in support you can offer. Him and I are so desperate for him to see a psychiatrist and get stable, and are waiting anxiously for next week when it’s finally happening… but even then I know it takes a while for the meds to help.

"Advice on long-term treatment for a bipolar depressed family member? My brother has had bipolar depression since he was a teenager, he's mid-20s now and still living with our retired father. Recently, he ""attempted suicide"" by jumping off a 15-foot balcony and breaking his feet, leading to hospitalization (and inpatient psych). Given the background context below, what would you do?

* He has talked about and threatened suicide hundreds of times

* This is the third time he's been hospitalized in the last 90 days (previously for psychosis and suicidal threats)

* Each time, he's released after 3-5 days after he begins to act normal and wants to go home

* Our father is a psychiatrist who desperately wants to help him, and has not been willing to ""kick him out"" of the house

* He has not been willing to consider longer-term inpatient psychiatric options (I don't know what options are available?) and because he always has had my father's home to return to, the hospital is always able to discharge him

* He has seen at least 20 psychiatrists in the last decade, and taken hundreds of different medications, with zero success

* He has received a year of ECT treatment, with significant memory loss and only temporary depression relief

* He dropped out of high school due to a combination of social phobia, depression, sensory issues, and rage issues

* He has never applied for a job

* He sometimes wishes to move into his own apartment, but that gets derailed by his constant suicidal threats, changing his mind about everything, easily becoming frustrated and overwhelmed, and at least for now, he can't even walk...

How do you end a revolving door of 5-day long emergency room and inpatient psychiatric visits? Is my father's home being open to him actually hurting his chances of recovery? Would being barred from returning home force him to choose between homelessness and long-term inpatient care?

I fucking want to but everything hurts so damn much and I never have energy and half the things I eat make my stomach feel like its going to explode. I do not want this fucking body. I hate how it looks, I hate how it makes me feel, I hate how hard it is to do basic tasks. I look in the mirror and I want to cry. I hate this fucking flesh vessel. I wish I could cut it into chunks and throw it away. I do not want it. It only makes me miserable. I just want energy to try and fix something about this so I can feel a little better.

"My mind &amp; body choses flight instead of fight.  I (26F), am going through it tonight. Honestly? I couldn't tell if my post belonged in the anxiety or rant subreddit, but I asked myself aloud, ""How do I feel?"", and my answer was: stressed.

So, here I am. 

Crying and bawling my eyes out. 'Why?' you might ask. Well, I'll tell you a little bit about me...I am an overweight female who has gone through shit in my 26 years of living. My childhood was basically robbed of me, mainly because I witnessed fights and screaming matches between family members and a near divorce with the parentals. I was also bullied majority of my early childhood all the way through middle school. After all of this happened (and there was a lot more than that), I felt like I was forced to grow up and basically chose 'flight mode' to save myself.

What I mean by that is, closing myself off. Staying in my room and coming out when I absolutely have to. I have a fear of being rejected, and being a failure. I am afraid of being yelled at for doing something wrong and I have a fear of getting into trouble and being reprimanded.

I still live with my parents and I have no job because of just basically, being socially anxious. I stutter around people I don't know and that makes me even more anxious and self-conscious. I forget things easily and that in turn, furthers my fear of being incapable of a job. On top of that, I have trouble sleeping at night because thoughts run through my head a million times a second. Because of this, I wake up late almost everyday (at 11am).

Just tonight, my mom basically dumped a, 'we need to talk' case on me and already I felt my blood run cold. She's talking to me but all I hear is my heart thumping in my ears. She tells me I need to work on waking up early because the rest of the world wakes up early like ""adults"". I felt very offended by that and told her that it's not my fault that I can't sleep properly at night. I, in fact, tell this to her everyday, so it's not old news. Yet, when I did remind her of this, she basically sighed and almost wanted to roll her eyes. Then she tells me I need a week to just 'work on myself' to fix that and realistically, thats not how that works but I didn't say anything.

Then she tells me I need to find a job. Something that pays and that 70% of the world gets up and does a 9 to 5 job which I already knew. Now, I was starting think she thinks I'm lazy or something when it's absolutely not the case.

Truth is, I have been getting together with my younger sister who is an artist on doing freelance stuff that we are both interested in doing. We have been talking about it little by little. I told my mom this and she didn't seem to believe me, basically looking at me with an expression of, ""Ohhh really like what"".

So she asks, ""Okay, what have y'all worked on today?"" of all things she asks on the day me and my younger sister decide to take at least the day off from planning. I said, ""Well, we are taking a break today but I designed some stuff for xx and sended it to her and she reformatted and polished it up."" my mom seemed to deflate in a way that said, 'That was it?' 

Not gonna lie, it made me feel bad and then she went into a repeated 5 minute lecture on how we need to wake up earlier and start the day like adults. Meanwhile I'm here depressed, stressed and just over it at this point. Over the fact that she just doesn't understand at all. She says, 'I know you can do it. I know that.'

But does she really? Anytime I do, 'do it', she seemes to be unsatisfied and that pushes me a million steps back. 

I get upset and after we finish talking, I go to my room to sleep (11pm at this point) and I just start bawling at how useless I felt and the whole, 'why is my life like this'.

It took so much in me not to burst into tears in front of her but man my throat was tighrening so bad it hurt that I couldn't speak for a good few seconds.

I don't know, I guess I just need some advice on the situation? Anytime I'm in this position my stress literally goes through the roof and I don't know how to manage it (like the need to runaway, disappear or worse). I really do want to work, I want to recieve a paycheck and get my own place and my own car and things, but why am I always on flight mode all the time?",Stress

"Does anyone find it so hard to get over a comment/criticism to the point they feel suicidal? Trigger warning. Mention of Eating disorders and suicide. 

A month ago my brother was talking about how he just turned 30. He was saying how he didn’t look 30 and he pointed to me and said “he looks older than me”. I’m 24. It felt like a stab in my heart. Ever since I’ve barely left the house. I wasn’t trying to date before that but now I’m not even going to try. I feel suicidal now and I don’t feel like life’s worth living. I’m old looking for my age so I should just give up. That comment is running through my mind 24/7. It’s torture. I feel so embarrassed. 
If my brother knew what that comment did to me, it would suck. I’m so angry but hurts. It’s not really his fault how I feel but why did he say that. I’ve struggled with eating disorders my whole life. I get anxious seeing my brother because I’m scared of what he will say. Everything reminds me of that comment. I have barely been eating. It just reminded me why I shouldn’t leave the house because other people will think the same. 

It feels like such a stupid reason to be suicidal over but it’s taking every bit of my energy not to do it everyday. How am I meant to go through life if a silly comment like that has gotten me like this. How do I get over it? I’m not strong enough to go through life.",Personality disorder

"Peaks and Valleys My dad was recently diagnosed with liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver.  It was pretty sudden.  Just months prior he appeared to be in solid health.  I was living about 4 states away over the past 19 years.  When I found out what was going on, I decided to move as close as I could to my parents.  I'm only 3 hours away now (I would be closer but my company doesn't have operations any closer than where I'm at...  Changing jobs is not an option for me at the moment).  He's experiencing delirium and is in pretty bad shape.  My family (wife and 2 young beautiful daughters) are still back at ""home"" until the kids finish school and they're all moving up.  We're in the process of listing the house and all that fun stuff too.  I've been fortunate enough to be able to stay at my sister and brother in law's home, rent free - they wouldn't accept any money.  So I cook for them,  make sure to buy my own groceries, buy some for them, help out around the house, etc.  So, all in all, I'm in about as comfortable a spot that I could ask for under the otherwise shitty circumstances.  Sorry about the long windedness...  But I guess I'm stuck in a bit of an ""episode."" It's understandable under these circumstances, but I don't think I've behaved like this before.  This is the second night in a row that I may not go to sleep.  It's 4:44; I get up in an hour.  Other days, I've not be able to get out of bed even when I when I went to sleep early. I've been sometimes sleeping till late in the afternoon, barely mustering the energy to shower, super low energy, depressed, etc...  I've definitely experienced all of those symptoms in my time, but not this intertwined.  These days seem to be in a  completely random order and far too many.

"Really bad health anxiety at night Some background... I was diagnosed with OCD in the third grade, but was suspected of having it long before that. I have bad intrusive thoughts. I've been in and out of therapy for many years. 

Within the past few years my health anxiety has gotten bad again, like it was when I was a child. In late 2016, when I was 19, I went through a phase where I thought I was dying Every. Single. Night. I ended up having so many panic attacks and losing a lot of friends. I lost over 60 pounds in like 2-3 months. I got into a relationship on the tail end of this breakdown and am still with my partner. It helped a lot and continues to help.

Now, like a year and a half later, it's not as bad as it was in that period, but the symptoms linger still. I haven't had a checkup since a little before the breakdown in 2016. I'll go to the doctor if I catch a cold or whatever but not for a checkup.

Now....this is because I'm like, terrified that I'll find out that I have a terminal illness. Cancer, of any type, kidney failure, some kind of disease... whatever, it doesn't matter. Whenever I think about it I freak out and get nauseous and scared. When I'm laying in bed at night I will feel my boobs for lumps, and always convince myself something is there when it isn't, in different parts of my boobs. I've gotten to a point where I dont even like touching them. 

I know it would be better to just find out and get to fix it asap, but it scares me so bad I'm afraid it would just ruin my will to live. :( I'm not currently in therapy but I know i need to be.

It's the worst at night when my boyfriend is asleep, but it's seeping over into my daily life. If my biology prof starts talking about cancer my thoughts just spiral out of control making me think I have it. It's gotten so bad that I actually have anxiety about the anxiety itself. :(

"I'm coming out of a hypomanic episode and need to talk about it. I've been hypomanic for the last 3 weeks. I'm medicated and I'm teetotal etc so it was relatively minor. But fuck me does the depression hit me like a ton of bricks. It's more physical than mental at first. My limbs get heavy. I have zero energy to get up and do simple things. I procrastinate. Skip a few meals. Not brush my teeth. Leave a chore that needs doing. Then in a few days I'll feel all the mental affects coming in. If I'm lucky I'll just be comatose for a month. But if a mixed state comes along then it's panic attacks, anxiety, despair and suicidal ideation. Fingers crossed it's just depression.

The hypomania was alright this time around. I have spent a bit too much, worked a bit too hard, overshared a bit too much, socialised a bit too much. But no real damage this time. It was intense but kind of pleasant. But I can feel the dip is going to be huge. This is anecdotal but it feels like if my mania is under control (no psychosis and no mixed state) the depression part is deeper. Feel kind of quietly melancholic on an epic scale. If that makes any sense.

It's going to be a slog for the next month. I should be happy I've got things under control I suppose. Anyone else want to share their experiences coming out of mania? It would make me feel better to hear others going through and surviving similar.",Bipolar

"How I am *almost* over my Health Anxiety Quick intro:
3 years a go I had an incident in the shower that mimicked a stroke. I came out of it unharmed but it messed me up psychologically. Ever since then my body takes any feeling it gets and goes into panic mode. Now i hate driving, i hate taking a shower, i hate exercising. You name it, if i makes me hot, i get anxious. At onc point i was so anxious showering i had to sit down and hold on for dear life the entire time i was in there.

Now i'm about 80% over it. and form my experience the only way over it - is to go through it. And what i mean by that is you need to face this demon head on. I know its the last thing you want to hear but trust me. If you never face it you will be running forever.

However it will take time for your brain to rewrite its default path ways. So at the moment the default behavior is fear, and to curl up and say please dont hurt me. So your brain interprets it as a threat and will spiral out of control causing all sorts of symptoms the worst of which being a panic attack.

Now next time you start getting the fear coming on try this instead. Say to your fear out loud ""Just kill me then"" ""Bring it on"" ""Lets see what you can do"" and taunt your fear and let what ever you think is going to happen happen. by wanting the what ever it is you are afraid of to happen will make the fear vanish.

Another thing to think. If you were to say have a heart attack it would just happen... whether you worried or not. Worrying isnt going to some how miraculously save you.

At my lowest - the turning point for me was when i just thought i'd rather be dead than to feel like this anymore. and from then on i basically laid down my life to my fear and said just kill me. Kill me now or shut the fuck up. I needed to hit rock bottom so I could rebuild my brain the right way. and for a few weeks i just kept saying ""Kill me now or shut up"" over and over until my brain started using the new default behavior. 

It can take months to retrain your brain and then add years on that to fully forget. but this is what is working for me.

TLDR: Taunt your fear. egg it on. call it out. ask it to do its worst even if it kills you. Let it flow through you and out the other side I bet nothing bad happens

TLDR 2: If you were going to die it would just happen... whether you worried or not. Worry isnt going to some how miraculously save you",Anxiety
"I'm forgetting what I am COMPLETELY talking about mid sentence. I don't drink, I don't do drugs. I'm completely forgetting what I am talking about. Everything irritates me.

It's a little easier writing then speaking. 

I'm pronouncing words wrong.

I am mostly communicating with my mom and she is so hard to talk to she cuts you off, gets upset if you dont agree and then never understands and so maybe I'm just so incredibly stressed because my subconscious is already expecting something strainous with communicating with her. 

Shes also over communicating like, I'm not getting any continuous space of silence from communication for a good period of time any day of the week. 

Which is not her fault but she does keep telling me things that are unnecessary like how she is going to go pick up the dog poop. I dont need a play by play of every single minor action.

"2019 resolution: be S.T.A.B.L.E. Hey friends! We made it through another year. I’m really proud of us. 

I’ve officially made it past the one year mark of my major manic episode post diagnosis. 2018 was really hard as I was in a depressive episode and had to work through medication and side effects for the first six months. 

I started a new job in September and started taking improv classes in May. Things are finally at a relatively calm place—for the first time since my husband and I got married in 20-5, it looks like we might have a nice quiet year without any major life changes (that happened to me in prediagnosis manic episodes)

We know that stability is never guaranteed. My goal this year is to do everything in my power to stay stable, and be able to steer through an episode if/when one comes up. So, what does stable mean to me?

S: Sleep. 8-10 hours, one hour without electronics, in bed by 10:30, out of bed by 7:30 
T: Therapy. Going to personal and couples therapy, meditation, journaling, being kind to myself through self talk.

"alright, so first i have to admit that my biggest need in life is to feel loved. not just loved, but to have someone that finds me attractive and is turned on by me and my body. including my penis. now, when i was younger. say, teen and young adult. i really did not care too much about my penis size. sure i would be a bit embarressed by it and was always one to hold off on sexual activities until i had been with a girl for a little while. but it did not because depression. I am in my 30's now and my life experiances has taken me from thinking ""size is not everything"" to litterally crying more often then i would like to admit over my penis size. I am a grower first off. and at full staff its not too bad i guess. below average but not micro by any means. but soft its less then an inch for sure. in fact. when I am sitting down its litterally inside me. anyway. because of this i have never been much for one night stands or to go around having sex with lots of woman. with the exeption of twice in my life, i have just been a long term relationship type. i have had 4 previous relationships (one was marriage for almost 10 years). and i am on my 5th currently. all 4 of those, i was cheated on. multiple times. my ex wife i had even found that she was telling the other guys that i was small and she did not get turned on my it. taking something i was already a little self consious about, and adding in that EVERY girlfriend i have had has cheated on me. i am now VERY needy in terms of exeptence of my penis size. my current relationship, we have sex once or twice a month and that is it. she says she is just not a very sexual person. but see, we were friends before we started dating and, she used to talk about loving to give blowjobs, and she even had a FWB just because she loved giving them so much she had someone she could just go suck any time she wanted. so i cannot help but feel like its me. like i have an underwelling penis that just does not get her going. my life at this point revolves around my self loathing over my penis size. I feel like the ONE thing i need more then anything i can never have because no girl gets excited about small penis'. the best i hear is woman that say they do not mind it. or that it does not matter to them. but i clearly have never even found that. i do love my current girlfriend and she is good to me any many non sexual ways. and i feel i cannot give my true feelings to her because that might seem like guilt tripping and when it comes to sex, guilt tripping someone, in many ways, is a bit..... well... i cannot think of the word so i will use an example. a guy that guilts a woman into sex because she gave him blue balls would be considered a pig right? so i feel like if i talked about this with her it would be similar. like..... oh you should have sex with me more because i need to feel like my penis size is ok.... i just cannot do that. i do not feel right about it. even if i know in my head that is not my reason. in my head I am not doing it as a guilt trip. that is still kind of too close to the same category. so i sit here. so damned depressed that i cannot even ""take care of myself"" when i feel the urge sometimes. i feel sad and like i will never feel truly loved and desired. you know, let us talk about porn for a moment. i am not one to use it when i am in a relationship. but i had a few years between my ex and my current girl to have watched a bit and really dig around to see what is out there. and i am starting to cave a bit and use it from time to time just because of how in frequent we have sex. but the point of bringing up porn is this.... there is fetishes for basically everything. feet fetishes. old people. fat people. short people. tall people. big boobs. small boobs. ect ect. i mean the list is endless. but you know what i cannot find? a porn fetish catagory for woman that like small dicks. you can find a fetish for woman that like to be pee'd on and deficated on. but not that like small penis'. in fact. the only small penis fetish i can find is HUMILIATION. which is the LAST thing i want to see and just know that its out there depresses me even more. its depressing to think that every woman i have ever been with has been so displeased by it that they decided to go find a bigger one to play with on the side. i tried anonymous video sites a few times when i was single and that left me crying every time. you find a girl that wants to cam with you. and as soon as she see's what i am working with, she either clicks off immediatly, or she stays to laugh and call it small. there was one time that i thought that maybe witholding the information that i had a small dick until the relationship was a few weeks old (or more) was my problem. so when i was talking to this one girl, i waiting for her to bring up sex in the conversation and when she finally did, i informed her i was small. she asked for a picture so i sent her one. she litterally just stopped replying. never heard from her again. like. i genuinly feel like maybe they feel like they have been scammed or something. start a relationship with me. i seem like a good boyfriend. and then bam. small dick. i do not know what to do. i know i should not put so much into my penis size. but my life experiances has caused this and i can no longer convince myself its ok. i can no longer believe size does not matter. or its the motion of the ocean. or that looks are not everything. or that you can make up for it in bed with other things like mouth skills and so on. i just want someone to genuinly like my penis. and i will never have that. small ""member"" causing major depression",Depression

"This is really getting out of control I feel exhausted from the constant voices in my head and my heart racing during social situations. I feel like everything I do, could have been done better, and that I am inadequate. My avoidance is getting worse to the point where I am unable to do anything at all. As a medical student, I chose to study this major without truly understanding the challenges that would come with it. Now, during my clinical rotations, every encounter with each patient feels like a nightmare. I constantly feel judged, and I fear harsh criticism is always one step away from being directed at me. This constant mental battle leaves me with no room to use the knowledge that I have worked so hard to achieve.
 I am always reserved and quiet, and I do not act on anything until I know there is no other option, fearing that I will be blamed for my incompetence. However, this has backfired on me, as I struggle to form connections and networks, losing out on many opportunities in my field that could improve my social and financial status. Gradually, people have started to label me as arrogant or irresponsible, which makes me feel hopeless. 
What can I do to sustain balance, at least in my mind? In addition to this, I am lonely, and the effect on my already-damaged mental health is apparent. 
Last year, I met a group of people with whom I shared similar interests. Socializing with them was enjoyable, and I felt liked. But, in my efforts to get closer to them and belong to the friend group, I ended up stressing over whether I was making them uncomfortable, whether I had anything interesting to say, and whether they looked down on me. The gut-wrenching anxiety became too much to bear, and I ended up quitting. I limited my texts and stopped going to meetings. Though I am still in contact with them on social media, I see how new people have joined the group, formed close friendships, and I continue to feel like a familiar stranger to all of them.
I am preparing myself to accept the lack of romantic intimacy in my life. Though I have always been indifferent about relationships, sometimes I think that I am going to miss out on so many ordinary but enjoyable experiences in life. There were guys who took an interest in me because I had this ""mysterious aura"" around me, but after a few more dates, I was still the same person they met on the first day. I had nothing more to offer other than shallow and unimportant conversations. Every time I wanted to go deeper, I felt exposed and vulnerable like prey. So, it's definitive for me that I have to completely abandon this part of my life and move on.

I'm a Googler and it's really starting to piss me off! Every single pain I get I end up googling it and lose my shit thinking it's cancer or something deadly. Heck, sometimes I don't even Google it and I just assume it's something bad! The anxiety got that bad in the summer time that I was crying every night and having no sleep thinking I was going to die and couldn't get out of bed for work. I'd literally made my self depressed. I then did actually get really ill from all the worry and stress. I just don't want to have death thoughts everytime I feel a pain or a niggle! I'm even getting scared of feeling my own breasts incase I feel a lump!!! I also hate it when I see articles on Facebook telling you the symptoms to look out for for certain cancers and then those symptoms are stuck in my brain for life and I end up tying those symptoms to my pains and thus the anxiety begins! I'm literally stressed and on edge every single day now, it's exhausting!

So my question is, is there anybody else out there suffering with this too? And how are you coping with it? I literally can't go on like this, feeling like i'm going to die all the time. It's an absolute waste of life.

"(Starting my senior year of college) - posted in r/suicidewatch as well. September 2017: Body dysmorphia leads me to believe I have gynecomastia. Plastic surgery research occupies most of my time.

"After years and years of people's bullshit, I have just became a bitter and closed off person compared to when I was a kid. Constant bullying, constantly being ignored or belittled, constantly being seen as not important, stuff like this make me really despise everyone I meet.

I am tired of constantly being the lighting rod of being looked down up and seen as a bad person when I am reality all I get is nothing but negative comments like racist or sexist slurs towards me or not supporting a belief or having doubts on an opinion. Yet they expect me to roll with the punches and shut up. I should give happiness to others when all I get is mental abuse and insults. that is why I despise happiness. I cannot bare to see someone happy because it reminds me of how selfish people can be. Even people who accomplished something makes me feel like shit because it feels like they are flexing the accomplishment when I am miles from them. Yet they expect me to cheer on the sidelines. It saddens me alot to see people in relationships or get opportunities while it feels like my life is on fucking repeat by eating and shitting. And if anything goes wrong, it is always my fucking fault. Dog hurt there paw? My fault. someone is tire gets flat, my fault. Someone is about to be robbed? Well guess who is fucking fault it is. I do not even need to be involved and somehow, everyone loves to put the blame on me. All these traits that people reflected onto me just make me wish for suicide sometimes.

"Scared to Start Meds :( Hey all. I’ve been in therapy since age 6, Baker Acted at 15, sent to inpatient treatment at age 17, stayed for a year for self harm, depression, and substance abuse.

In inpatient they just said I needed to find god and quit smoking pot and life would be dandy. Then, the inpatient program took me off my depression and ADHD meds because I traded adderall for a cigarette. Life was miserable.

So, I went straight to university after inpatient treatment (genius move) and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I think that the diagnosis is fitting but I don’t trust it completely; what if it’s BPD or Cyclothymia? 

Fast forward a year, I dropped my therapist. School is tough because I’m either so hyped up I think that I don’t need school because I’m a genius and a god among men and can do anything I want with my life. Other times, I’ll miss a week of classes and do no work because I hate myself and want to die. 


All in all,  I’m so used to dealing with the symptoms that I don’t want to take meds or go back to therapy because I’m scared of the side effects. I don’t want to lose my sex drive or get fat or be lazy.  I don’t want to give up drugs and alcohol. And I’m really distrustful of doctors because not a one has helped me in the past.

One of my friends recently asked me if I wanted to go to a concert in August. I love the musician, and I'm sure I'd enjoy the show. But my initial honest reaction was ""I don't even know who I'll be by then."" I didn't say that out loud, but it was a clarifying moment. Does anyone else have this issue? (Probably.)

An added unwanted effect is that this makes me come across as flaky, disorganized, or unreliable -- and I'm not saying I'm definitively NOT those things. Bums me out, though. I can use a calendar app, I swear. I just do not know how I'll be feeling a month from now.

Not to mention, I'd hate to bring someone else into the world and they feel as bad as I do. It seems selfish of me to have a kid on a whim and then end up being a shitty dad. 

I don't know how to tell my wife. I love her, she makes me so happy, but I don't know if I can do this. She's not pregnant, but she's off the pill and we've decided to take a loose take on ""trying"". We already don't have a lot of sex. 

Am I right about this or is this just my chemically off balanced brain making itself feel worse? Am I the only one who thinks like this?",Bipolar
"Does anyone experience rage regarding silly things?

"bad depressive episode due to stress from college hi!! i got diagnosed + medicated back in November. currently on 200mg lamotrigine. my mood swings have slowed down, however i’ve been noticing ive been more depressed as of late and going onto day 4 of feeling like this.

im currently unsure if it’s because im not on the right meds or the amount of pressure im under rn. i feel horrible bc i havent been going to any of my college classes these past 2.5 weeks. i have also not been completing assignments which is also bringing me down. i just dont have the energy for it rn. the stress im under is due to my grades dropping and the possibility of me losing my full ride scholarship

we went on spring break and i was the happiest ive ever been w/o being manic. once school kicked in ive been sleeping in all day. i really think my episode is due to stress rather than my meds. but god it sucks so badly. it just reminds me of how bad my episodes used to be.

"How do you make a loved one understand? My SO does not deal with any mental illness himself. But more than that he was misdiagnosed as a teen as having severe mental illness and was medicated. He now holds a lot of resentment towards the field in general. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have Bipolar II. I have suffered for years and years. No medications work, though I did have great luck with dTMS. A full year of no depression and no suicidal thoughts. I thought I was in heaven, I swear. 

&amp;#x200B;

But that's all worn off now. I'm taking my medicine, I'm trying my hardest, but it's just not working. I'm having full meltdowns nearly daily and it's only a matter of time before I need to commit myself again. This time last year I did a 10 day stint in the psych ward after a suicide attempt. And those feelings are back and so so strong. 

&amp;#x200B;

My SO keeps my medicine under lock and key, luckily. But now ECT is on the table. He doesn't think the time off work is justified nor the cost. But he doesn't understand. I could die. And if I do attempt and it doesn't work, the hospital bills for inpatient treatment are going to be far higher than the cost of ECT, plus I would very likely lose my job.

He says if this was cancer, and I needed 6 weeks off work for chemo, it would be a different story. Cancer is killing you, depression is just rough. How do I explain that I'm dying?

I cannot interact with people well enough to get a date in the first placeBad news: mostly bad news. The thoughts are still there and boy oh boy are they growing. So during a few meltdowns I have done a real bad thing where I just walk out and go as far away as possible, remembering plan A in the process. Now they have been nagging me to do it more outside of meltdowns - mall, grocery store, park; hell, we got in a car crash a few weeks ago (dw everyone is ok) and I thought to just start walking and hope no one notices. Literally the only thing that stopped me was the cops sowing up to assess the damage. Speaking of plan a, that is also been nagging more. Not much to elaborate there.Another thoughts been growing, the one that I have had it too good. Been noticing my appetites going down cuz I feel like I do not deserve whatever I am eating. More commonly with meltdowns Ill try to get rid of clothes, jewelry, phone, etc thinking only good kids get to have it. I hardly even want to go anywhere anymore cuz all the fun places are good kid things and I should not have that.

I think it was triggered after my grandpa died, and my mom turning 50, and being left alone with my thoughts during the summer.

Then I will take midol and fall asleep at 8 PM. I stopped showering as often, stopped eating. I eat breakfast and that is it. I have tried to stay hydrated at least. I am currently working on creative projects (a web series, lots of writing), and it provides a distraction. But I have nothing to do after that. I recently met up with a childhood friend and even when we talked I felt myself feeling depressed 'why am I even here right now nothing matters' idk. I tried clinging to religion but even that does not help me. I find myself worrying about running out of time. I am 21, and just started my first year of college.

I have only ever been in one real relationship and I was a rebound the entire time. I was blind to it and I felt true love for that person. I would have done anything for him. I thought he would, too. But I realized I was sorely mistaken. Before that relationship and ever since, no one has taken me seriously. I have been sexually assaulted (that is how I lost my virginity), or I have been used. No one is genuine anymore. My degree, that I worked so hard to earn, is useless. I still live with my parents.

I do not see the value of my life anymore. I am not happy. I do not know if I ever will be. And I have only come this far because I failed once, and because it would devastate my mother. I have thought very seriously about buying a gun. Driving to a remote area and just ending it there. A friend of mine did just that two years ago. No one ever saw it coming.

"I think I have bone cancer Im 20 years old (male) and im 6' 3"" 170 lbs

Let me start of by saying that for most of my life i think i have symptoms and i think im gonna die everytime untill i finally go to the doctor aand find out its some minor problem.

Ok so in spring of 2015 i noticed the muscle above my knee was twitching a lot so i got into the habit of feeling that area every day until i noticed a hard lump developing on my bone. I was CERTIAN i had bone cancer until i found out i had osteochondroma wich is a benign tumor and not life threatining. I decided not to have it removed.

Two years later (this last summer) i started have muscle twitches all over my body. Those lasted like 5 months and they still happen occasionally but mostly they've been replaced by painful/tender spots on various bones in my body including my spine.

Anyways the bones in my feet hurt a lot and in my hands. Butttt basically every bone in my body has a spot where it hurts.

My pee also started burning last summer and i was tested for various STDs  and the doctor just kinda brushed it off just like he did with all of the other symptoms im describing. And idk if this is related but ive been constipated for 11 days but i can go with laxatives.

I usually go to the gym but havent in a week in a half due to travel and ive actually gained 20 pounds (in muscle) over the last 6 months.

What i really want to know is there ANY possibility that this isnt serious?

When I said I'll probably skip again, she looked at me with so much disappointment, and said ""I really should stop caring about people that much"".

It didn't register then, but it hits me now how hurt I am from her words. It feels like I'm not doing good enough, and I probably am not. So that day I forced myself to sit through the class and even showed some progress to my professor. But I can't get the look on her face out of my mind.

To be fair to her, I said I needed to leave in a kinda joking manner because that's my coping mechanism. So maybe she didn't think I felt as horrible as I did and thought i wanted to skip to avoid work.",Personality disorder

"I don’t know what to do This is long I’m sorry. 

Symptoms started in January, just feeling off, super tired, nauseous, headaches almost everyday, always feel as if I’m about to get sick (hot throat, run down, feeling like lymph nodes were swollen, etc). At this time I was attempting to recover from binge eating disorder and going through a bout of seasonal depression, and my doctor said it’s the depression making me feel all this. Prescribed me Zoloft, which I took for two weeks and stopped because the headaches I got everyday were unimaginable. 

The feeling of something being off physically never goes away. Start to feel a constant ache in my ears down the side of my neck and under my jaw. I mean literally every second of everyday. Still frequent headaches. Still feel lymph nodes are swollen. Wake up one morning at the end of March and my throat feels worse than it has in 10 years. Go to medexpress and I have strep. I thought maybe that’s what it’s been all this time?! Antibiotics work after a few days on the throat but all other symptoms remain. 

Between February and March I went to an ENT who basically dismissed me and said I have TMJ, looked in my ears which he said looked perfectly healthy. So then I go to my dentist and he took an x ray of my entire head showing all jaw joints, which are normal. No sign of grinding. Looked confused when I told him right in the morning when I wake up is when I feel the best, then it gets worse throughout the day. Still gave me a mouth guard to wear at night but makes no difference. 

If I was in constant anxiety over this I would chalk it up to that but I’m really not. My CBC, diff, platelets, and all my chemistries were all normal, so that helps a lot. I’m just so tired of feeling this way.

"Latuda Withdrawals/Akathisia Hi All,

I was put on Latuda for about 3 weeks (1 at 10mg, 2 at 20mg) as my previous stabiliser wasn't doing much for me. I assumed my worsening depression/anxiety were withdrawals but by week 3 I ended with akathisia that has really fucked me up.

Pdoc took me off it immediately and prescribed me 0.25mg Xanax to take as needed (which I had been taking one or two of intermittently to cope with the transition) It's been 12 days since my last Latuda dose but I'm still having major depression/panic/crying fits and I'm concerned that the longer I take the Xanax the more reliant I'm going to become on it. I'm already taking between 1.25-2mg/day and while I'm having more frequent periods of stability, it's sometimes taking more Xanax to get there and boy do I come crashing down hard once that 5 hour mark passes.

Has anyone had similar experiences coming off Latuda? I'd think that with only 3 weeks on I'd be in the clear by now, but I've heard some horror stories and I'm also terrified of replacing one set of symptoms with another the longer I stay on Xanax.

"This is really getting out of control I feel exhausted from the constant voices in my head and my heart racing during social situations. I feel like everything I do, could have been done better, and that I am inadequate. My avoidance is getting worse to the point where I am unable to do anything at all. As a medical student, I chose to study this major without truly understanding the challenges that would come with it. Now, during my clinical rotations, every encounter with each patient feels like a nightmare. I constantly feel judged, and I fear harsh criticism is always one step away from being directed at me. This constant mental battle leaves me with no room to use the knowledge that I have worked so hard to achieve.
 I am always reserved and quiet, and I do not act on anything until I know there is no other option, fearing that I will be blamed for my incompetence. However, this has backfired on me, as I struggle to form connections and networks, losing out on many opportunities in my field that could improve my social and financial status. Gradually, people have started to label me as arrogant or irresponsible, which makes me feel hopeless. 
What can I do to sustain balance, at least in my mind? In addition to this, I am lonely, and the effect on my already-damaged mental health is apparent. 
Last year, I met a group of people with whom I shared similar interests. Socializing with them was enjoyable, and I felt liked. But, in my efforts to get closer to them and belong to the friend group, I ended up stressing over whether I was making them uncomfortable, whether I had anything interesting to say, and whether they looked down on me. The gut-wrenching anxiety became too much to bear, and I ended up quitting. I limited my texts and stopped going to meetings. Though I am still in contact with them on social media, I see how new people have joined the group, formed close friendships, and I continue to feel like a familiar stranger to all of them.
I am preparing myself to accept the lack of romantic intimacy in my life. Though I have always been indifferent about relationships, sometimes I think that I am going to miss out on so many ordinary but enjoyable experiences in life. There were guys who took an interest in me because I had this ""mysterious aura"" around me, but after a few more dates, I was still the same person they met on the first day. I had nothing more to offer other than shallow and unimportant conversations. Every time I wanted to go deeper, I felt exposed and vulnerable like prey. So, it's definitive for me that I have to completely abandon this part of my life and move on.

I just want to do my task earn my pay and then enjoy my free time. I really like WFH, wearing a mask to hide my face and people keeping a distance I never want those things to end.

"Scared of bad diseases and death in the young ages Hello everyone
I'm a medical student (22 y/o) and it's about 2 year that I'm suffering from anxiety about my health. 

I think about my body and symptoms  
almost every hour of the day. I'm always scared about that i have a bad disease and will it kill me or something.

I usually experience physical symptoms and I can't really find out whether this symptoms are real or only because of my anxiety.
Over the past 2 years, I experienced lots of symptoms all over my body (now I'm experiencing stomach problems and sleep problems) visited lots of doctors and took lots of medicine. Now its for a few months that i started to feel depressed and lost my motivations. Don't now what to do at all.

I will be happy if you share some ideas. Tnx",Anxiety
"Worried Hey so I’ve been a hypochondriac for quite some time now. A few days ago I slept with this guy and even though I used a condom and I’m on birth control I’m worried I may be pregnant. My period still hasn’t come yet but it can also be irregular sometimes due to my birth control, ( I’m on Nexplanon). I read online that taking high amounts of Vitamin C and taking Dong Qaui and Black Cohosh supplements can help with miscarriage. I started taking 2 capsules of 568 mg of Dong Qaui and 2 capsules of 540 mg of Black Cohosh every 2 hours and 5,000 mg of Vitamin C since Monday. I was also pressing down hard on my uterus a few days ago and now my uterus is tender to the touch, I’m experiencing nausea, lightheadedness and racing heart rate. The nausea, lightheadedness and racing heart rate could be due to my anxiety but I don’t know. 

I realize that what I did was stupid and I stopped taking the supplements but now I’m worried what if I injured myself my pressing down too hard on my stomach? I’m thinking of maybe going into urgent care tomorrow and I’m also scared to tell my doctor, I feel like at times she really judges me for having anxiety.

By real job, I don't mean anything fancy, I just mean full-time, steady work. He had a hard time asking store clerks where an item was located.  When I asked him how he overcame his ""extreme shyness"", he replied that my mom bossed out it out of him. She has introverts in her family, but they can be loud, and opinionated as well.

"Being a ghost would be my ideal form of existence. I really enjoy watching people live their lives, listening indirectly to their conversations while in public, being an observer of events etc. My problem is having to interfere on the world, I hate having to talk and to do things that will have consequences in it. I wish I could just watch life like a tv show or as if I was a ghost, in a way that no one could see me, nothing would be expected of me and I wouldn't need to worry because I would be certain of it. I could just contemplate the world in peace.

Some of you guys may have watched Euphoria and I definitely feel a connection with the description made about Lexi, how she felt like she was an just observer and that her life was not really her life, just some sort of play or movie.

These days I been having the classic ""I want to leave all behind and live in the woods with just a dog"" idea and daydreams, and I guess that a big part of it is because I feel like there I could be like this, or at least similar enough. Be an observer of nature, never having to deal with socialization again, only brief interactions for, let's say, buy necessary stuff from other people (which I don't mind). I know this isn't realistic for my context and also that it probably wouldn't be this magical thing, but it's a fantasy that brings me satisfaction.

I guess I'm just burned out of people. A lot of bad things happened in my relational and social life since childhood till last year and I'm really bitter about it right now. Of course I want to find real connection, where I could be myself openly and comfortably, but because it always goes wrong and brings disappointments I'm really hopeless at this point and honestly kinda angry.

I'm getting a colonoscopy later this week because of some gastrointestinal issues (I'm in my 20s), and my doctor has assured me multiple times he is not expecting colorectal cancer based on my symptoms. However, it's all I can think about. I can't stop Googling my symptoms, finding people younger than me who were diagnosed with cancer, finding people with less symptoms than me finding out they had cancer, etc.

"I will preface this by saying that usually I try to take on this image of being a provider/protector, solid as stone, cracking jokes, always happy to help, respectful as can be, rational, and so forth. Typical ""manly-man"" type of stuff that I was raised to internalize as markers of my self worth. But man, if there is anything I want in this world, it is to be cared about. I want to be loved, and I am sure I have someone in my life that does but if so they do not really show it... I have a bunch of surface-level friendships with people I cannot just text and talk to or ask to hang out. I have one friend but she is now in a relationship, with a guy that I have become great friends with in recent times, and out of respect for him and their relationship I try not to vent to her as much anymore like we mutually used to, plus I feel like a bother. I am no softy but I wish I had someone that I could just be vulnerable around and not only be cared by, but care for. I am moving in about a month anyways so it makes no sense to try and get into a relationship but the new job I am starting will make it very difficult to start a long term relationship. I wish I had a cuddle buddy if anything. Totally non-sexual, uninvolved, but just someone that I can turn on a movie with and snuggle up against. Maybe fall asleep. I feel totally pathetic writing that but it could not be closer to the truth. It seems that all I am really good at is getting angry, being angry, and feeling like an asshole when I know I am anything but. I am 99% sure the reason for this is that my dad is mostly a good guy, that can get REALLY angry, but only when someone is being beyond stupid or inconsiderate. I guess I rationalized this as being mad = being right, and if someone pisses *me* off, out of all people, it must be for a good reason. it is really just me being on a power trip for a short moment because otherwise I feel incompetent at most shit. I think I just like being mad because it gives me some sense of superiority, and also because deep down, I am just secretly a lonely, hurt man who is tired of having to hide his emotions.I guess I will end it off on some good news. I love running. there is countless trails I run on that no one else really goes on, so I just leave my phone at home or in the car, and just go. I feel so free. And at the end of each one, there is always a beautiful view waiting for me, so I take a break and just kind of stare off and appreciate it before heading back home and enjoying my short-lived runners high. I am also pretty good at basketball and enjoy playing it. that is really the only time I am happy most days, otherwise it is just constantly checking my phone to no new texts, and playing video games and patiently waiting to head to bed just to not sleep.

"Content with the idea of suicide. Here's why Content with the decision?

Hi everyone,

First time poster and visitor. And suicidal. But not in a sad, angry sort of way. Let me explain. 

I have a myriad of uncomfortable, growing, and lifelong genetic disorders that aren't obviously visible. I have lumps everywhere that may be cancerous, and I'm currently in the process of finding out. I also have type 2 bipolar disorder. My teeth, lips, mouth, tonsil, and throat structures are all shades of fucked, meaning I'll need multiple surgeries, braces, and apnea machines in my future. My family has a history of a few kinds of cancer, heart problems, liver problems, balding, and Alzheimer's. I'm freshly in my twenties, so thinking about how ugly this can get for me is seriously worrying and a complete drain on any vision I have of the future. 

But that's not really the primary reason I want to leave this world. I just feel complete, finished, done. Not in a depressive way (at least, not all the time), but in a closure / final chapter sort of way. 

I have felt nothing but love from family and friends, have had many successful relationships, have had a super privileged life, and have set myself up for a decent future after Uni. However, I just don't care. I'm content with the time I have spent here and would rather burn out than fade away. My medical issues will surely put myself and my family into debt. My studies feel worthless even though I am excelling - and they have always felt that way. I never thought I'd make it past 18, and have no real vision of myself past 21.

Every day feels like unnecessary time to be spending. I feel like I should close my book and leave while I am content with my life up to now.

"I feel I'm becoming obsessed with the fear of being diabetic. Don't really know how to stop thinking about it. If this belongs more on r/diabetes I apologize and I'll remove if needed. 

TL;DR: Been scared of being diabetic since 2016 and got myself tested twice since last year. They found nothing, but because of my anxiety, I can't stop obsessing over it, wondering if i really do have it and they just misdiagnosed me and I don't know what I can do to trust the word of the Doctor or stop obsessing over it all. 

Over the past year or so, since 2016, I feel I've been fearful over being a diabetic. It's scary to me. Back in 2016, when I was having some frequent urination problems, I went and looked it up(Big mistake, I know...) and saw that they were possibly linked to things like diabetes, anxiety, prostate cancer I think I saw also..and diabetes was the one I started to worry the most about. So I looked into the other symptoms and started to piece together in my mind that I might have it. 

After some fighting with myself, I went and got myself tested. Blood test showed nothing and I was able to relax and calm myself, and it felt like the frequent urination problem I had stopped after hearing that.
 
The problem came back though in last November. In December 2017, I got myself tested once again for it, this time they gave me a urine test. Saying that they would do a blood test if the sugar in it was high enough. Which did worry me a little because it wasn't what I was used to seeing with diabetic tests, but I did my best to trust it.  They didn't need to do the blood test and said that things were okay.

Then this year, I felt i started to doubt it, thinking I was being misdiagnosed, that the test wasn't accurate enough and that I do have it, they just haven't figured it out yet.

I feel I'm gonna go back to my doctor's for a 3rd time to get tested because I'm waking up at night to urinate. But I don't know how to stop obsessing and panicking over this. It feels like every time something minimal goes wrong with my body. My mind is sent into overdrive, thinking it's something truly awful going on with me.

"Heart anxiety is back thanks to weird arm pains My anxiety is back. 

This time, this weird arm pain that extends from my elbow to my hand is triggering it.  Logically, I know that it's likely due to the fact that I tend to lean on my left arm, but my brain keeps telling me ""well, what if it isn't?"" 

The pain usually happens when I'm resting my arm on my leg or have it bent to some capacity (it happened about 5 or so times during an hour video game session), but I've been lying in bed and it hasn't happened since. It doesn't seem to get worse with exertion either, as I run and do other cardio and weights at least 4 times a week. It just comes and goes seemingly at random.

I want to believe it's nothing wrong and it's a nerve thing at worse. My mind won't let me. To it, any arm pain like this is impending doom. I just wish I could shake this feeling.",Anxiety

After his death, they burned all of his things (laptop, books, etc.) and never talked about the reason of his death ever again.

"Health Anxiety is ruining my life. So it all started getting worse when about three weeks ago I accidentally got hit in the forehead with a soft car seat... I wasn't knocked out or anything, A &amp; E said I had no serious injuries, no bruise etc. 

My Health Anxiety's like, ""Well how do you know you're fine, you should see a doctor again so that nothing new has come up.""

I go to the doctor, I phone two different doctors and they tell me I don't have any signs of a serious head injury... I end up freaking out a few days later because of persistent headaches and feeling spaced out, so I go to the A &amp; E again, a different doctor gives me a neurological examination and tells me I don't have any serious injuries and should be more concerned about my anxiety. 

Then out of nowhere one of my relatives has a heart attack and is in hospital (he's fine and well now) and I start to worry. A few days after visiting him, I'm at my boyfriend's house and lying in bed... I'm getting these headaches that have lasted about a week now as well as a sudden pain in my arm and chest, and become totally convinced that I'm having a heart attack or a stroke. It doesn't help that I was starving myself because I was so stressed out; I had lost half a stone in the space of a week. I thought that I was dying because I hadn't eaten and was having heart problems because of this.

So now my HA brain thinks I've had a stroke twice without noticing or being diagnosed and that I have a damaged brain and that I also might have a brain tumour.

I've not been able to smell or taste things as well since I got a minor bump on the forehead, but it's quite possibly the case that my anxiety is convincing me I have these symptoms... so I've remained in this constant heightened state of numbness because of my anxiety; believing that I have some sort of serious condition... I was even at an audiologist because I believed that a visit to the cinema had permanently damaged my hearing, everything was fine and he said I had no hearing damage...

I go to the doctor again because of my severe anxiety; she tells me that all of my symptoms (headaches, ringing in ears, loss of sense of smell) are being caused by my anxiety. She prescribes me with propranolol... naturally I look up the side effects and become terrified to take the medication.

Just today, I started getting a headache and was convinced I was taking a stroke again. I've became kind of emotionally numb now because I'm constantly ruminating about what could be wrong with me health-wise. I can't even enjoy things anymore because my HA goes, ""Well maybe you can't enjoy that or feel much emotions or think about that the same way as you did before because you have brain damage caused by an undiagnosed TBI or a stroke."" I can't pay attention to things.

It doesn't matter what the doctors say, after a few hours I'm always convinced that they're wrong and that there's a serious problem with my brain and they haven't been able to find it yet.

I'm so sick of this. Can anyone else relate?

"Shortened Medical Leave Background information: I was diagnosed with bipolar type II back in September and I work as a teacher.

"I think I have AvPD (avoidant personality disorder) I have recently come across AvPD and I realized that I relate to almost all of the symptoms. First off, I’m very anxious in almost all social situations. This includes hanging around friends i’ve known for many many years, being around extended family (who i’ve also known for many years), being around coworkers, meeting new people, and even just going grocery shopping. 

I often try to avoid a lot of social situations which has definitely affected a lot of my relationships. I’m not very close with my friends or family anymore. I still hangout with them sometimes but it’s not on a very deep level. I don’t really open myself up to anyone. I’m scared of people figuring out my true personality and that they won’t like me for who I am. I hide lots of parts of my personality and not one person on this earth truly knows me. I’m close enough with my parents that I don’t get anxious around them, however I still hide many pieces of myself and don’t feel comfortable enough to show everything about myself. 

I have also struggled to find jobs that don’t make me anxious. It took me until I was 18 years old until I finally got my first job because of this. I currently work at a daycare and have worked here for about 7 months and my anxiety has seemed to get worse. I have been thinking about quitting for awhile now but am terrified of having the conversation with my boss about quitting. 

Whenever I’m at work, I feel inferior to everyone else. I feel like I have less experience, I overthink everything, and I am so awkward around my coworkers and parents. I feel like I’m incompetent and people don’t take me seriously because of my poor communication skills. My mind often goes blank when I’m asked questions and I don’t feel like I’m much of a help. I also try to focus completely on the kids and I would rather not form any real relationships with other coworkers. I try to keep conversations polite and small. I rarely talk about myself either, just enough to get by. I play it safe. 

I’ve always just felt like there was something wrong with me. Social anxiety kinda describes the way I feel but it seems like it’s more than just that.",Personality disorder
"Vyvanse and Bipolar 2 I don’t have ADHD or Binge Eating Disorder, let me preface this with that.

Does anyone have experience with taking Vyvanse without one of the regular prescribed  diagnosis?

"Accepting bipolar and getting medicated First time posting here. Actually, I made a post earlier and deleted it because it was long. I am diagnosed BP1 (mixed episodes, rapid cycling), PTSD and ADHD. The meds I took only made things worse so I stopped. I've been fighting symptoms unmedicated due to subconscious fear and denial.

I had a psychotic episode last week that lasted a few days. At one point I recognized my delusions for what they were but the feelings didn't leave. I even had the presence of mind mind to mention inpatient. But I was too scared. So instead of taking it out on my husband verbally, I internalized. I have so much self loathing that I felt I deserved to be hurt. To die. I didn't deserve my family. But I couldn't abandon them either. I love them and they should have so much better than me. 

In the past month or two I stopped taking care of myself. I feel so stressed. I force myself to eat once every other day. I haven't been showering or grooming in a while. Fighting addiction. Not sleeping. Car keeps breaking and I can't keep up with bills. I hate myself but want to change. Would you go to the new appointments or consider inpatient at this point?

"Swollen lymph nodes (for years) driving me up the wall. Ugh Hello! I just found this sub and it's so nice to know it isn't just me. 

This month has been full of health issues and to try to make it a long story short, an eating disorder gave me a ton of symptoms that I didn't even consider were from not eating such as really bad nerve pain, dizziness, lethargy, LOTS of weight loss, etc. I was POSITIVE the nerve pain, positioned right over my left chest, was a heart attack and went to the ER at 4am. They did an EKG, a blood test, urine test, a full physical and xray. Everything was a-okay aside from malnutrition and general ED signs.

I started eating regularly and every symptom went away completely. I feel healthier than I have in a long time (go figure. eating helps) and I felt reassured and content for about 3 weeks.

Something else that is important to note is I had shingles at around age 15 with very swollen and painful lymph nodes and a lot of them never went down.

Some of my friends do not hesitate to publish pictures that make them look and feel sensual... My take on that is everyone has their freedom to do anything and everything as long as it does not because harm to the community and or to another living being I am not bothered with it.

It would have been awkward for me to change my desk at that point instead I had to change her team and reporting boss so that she sat next to him... But now after doing all that today we broke up because another friend of mine commented on my status on fb who seemed to have an attractive dp which again led her to believe I am involved with her physically... Even after sharing all my passwords and IDs, my banking information and everything she still thinks I am spending money on other women which I clearly do not...So yeah from not a high paid job, no education and now no partner, nothing's doing me any good... Maybe I am crying out for some sympathy here but I am not lying when I say I am lost... I was a cheerful person who was passionate about dancing (though I was never good at it) but now I have got no passion for nothing...Oh I had to lose my passion for dance because my ex and I used to dance together and yes back then I was involved with her physically and would often participate in making love but when she lost her affection towards me (plus started cheating on me) I was understanding enough and have no ill feelings for her... because the heart wants what the heart wants I only wished she had spoken to me before cheating but that was her decision to make... So my current gf ever since then asked me not to watch dance videos/shows anything that adds fuel to my passion... Side note I did not have sex with my current gf but I did tell her that I am very much attracted to her and would like to do it. She asked me to not ask this of her before marriage and I do respect that. In the last 4 years I have probably asked her for it only thrice.... Except for the first time the other two both ended with very bad arguments and name callings from her end... The most we have done is kiss and that is all.... I am sorry if all this seems pathetic but it is how it is and I cannot help it neither can I stand it anymore.... If anyone reads the entire thing, THANKYOU it meant a lot....

"Is it okay that I did nothing over my month off from university? Hi all, thank you for stumbling upon this post. 

The fall semester ended for me in mid-December, and I resume for the spring semester in a week. I'm reflecting on the time I spent while having absolutely no academic, social, or financial responsibility... to say the very least, I'm not very pleased with how I dedicated my time. Much of it was spent sleeping, binge-watching shows, cooking, and staying inside. I did get some important things done, but I can't help but think, ""why couldn't I have done more?"" I had hoped to do some exploring or go out more frequently to enjoy the outdoors. I'm disappointed in myself for not doing so.

At the same time, I'm reminding myself that I needed to not do anything for a whole month after a year and a half of consecutive working. This was my first break in a really long time. I'm just upset about how unwisely I spent it... I don't know.

"Heart Disease, depression, anxiety, and stress This semester I am taking Abnormal Psychology. One of the chapters I had the misfortune of reading was on the physical health effects of negative emotions, something I am chocked full of. Whether its stress, anxiety, depression, anger/frustration, I show it. My mood bounces around a lot. 

Even at my young age of 23 I am starting to worry about developing heart disease, something my neurotic nature seems to be a predictor of. Most of my life I've eaten a poor diet (although my cholesterol was only 150, with my LDL at 88 and my HDL at 30. No idea about cortisol, CRP, or interlukins though). 

I have also been pretty sedentary (though that is very slowly starting to change) since I turned 18 and have had a slew of medical problems since then. My gums have receded more (I fought off gingivitis but am on the cusp of developing gum disease from gum recession). I used to get very angry at video games, I developed tinnitus a year ago which drives me crazy, and I'm depressed and socially isolated. 

I have no know history of heart disease, but of depression and low serotonin. Thus I am stuck in a dilemma. I also started taking amphetamine mediation for ADHD in January, so my heart rate tends to be higher on average but I eat less and have lost weight. In some cases, my blood pressure is normal on stimulants even when it feels elevated. I'm paranoid about my health, a bit of hypochondriac. I vape, don't drink anymore, and and am an on and off smoker. 

All of these things and more point to heart disease. I cannot just relax however, and I refuse to take antidepressants. I detest those medications and will take any medicine for depression that is not an antidepressant or antipsychotic. Even at the cost of my life from getting heart disease, I will risk low mood, higher inflammation, and more clotting and an early death than take those. 

I have often been pointed to exercise as the key, which I will do in the form of jogging. I will not do yoga, even if its ""relaxing"" because I think its a stupid form of a exercise. I want a form of exercise where I can feel angry and aggressive. Maybe that defeats the point but at least its something. 

I need some answers within my confines. Diet changes are hard because I'm a picky eater and will throw up if something doesn't taste good. Regular, good sleep is also out of the question because, for some reason, I rarely sleep more than 4-5 hours consecutively. Exercise is pretty easy, I'm just a bit lazy. 

I'm open to ideas but antidepressants are absolutely out of the questions. ",Anxiety

"My friend is bipolar and suicidal, asking for advice Hey

So a few months ago a good friend of mine, after a night of drinking told me had been planning to kill himself on April 8th but wasn't going to anymore. It is clear he was thinking about this when he was in a low state and he was definitely more manic at that point when we were talking. He has been starting to understand his own ebbs and flows.  He texted me the other day after cancelling on me telling me that he was emotionally drained after this past weekend and needed some space. I've made sure he knows I care about him and I am here for him and have tried to be respectful of his space, but also, April 8th is this weekend and I know he is in a depressive state. My only slip up was I messaged him about a possible trip together, but realized that might have been more overwhelming. I want to make sure I see him this weekend. 

It's going to be a rough weekend for me, my great aunt passed away,  so her wake and funeral is this Saturday morning. I was thinking of messaging him:

 ""Hey, I'm sorry to be messaging you so much. 

I'm going to be home this weekend and it's kind of looks to be a rough one. It would be really good to see you. I'll be around Saturday night or Sunday if you could swing it.""

Do you think this will also be overwhelming? Should I just mention I'll be around and not my personal stuff that he might feel like he has to take on? 
I don't want to just show up at his house but I'm not above it. Would love your thoughts on how you would either best approach this or how you'd feel most comfortable in his shoes.

"[Question] Burned out but boss loves my ability and will continue to incentivize if I do more TLDR : 3 questions at end regarding how to not care to disappoint when team and boss have seen my abilities. Boss has high aspirations for me this year or which if I fulfill I’m going to stretch myself so thin that I will leave or go into depression.


I was given a rather good yearly review, and well incentivized, but I am currently stressed, and trying to figure out how to have less responsibilities, when it’s desired I have more. This is above and beyond the rest of my team.

Boss sees my “potential” and not only wants it to continue, but also have me lead more, be more of a driver and influencer, and upgrade my knowledge, cross-team visibility. All of which I do not want. Taking on any more work feels like I’m going to “pop” and I’m already near / at burnout.

I hate disappointing and failing (why I try harder than others on my team; and also why I’m hate being in this position I am right now) but I’m at my max currently near / in burnout, thinking or ways to get out. My mindset is that I’d rather quit a 6fig job and go elsewhere / take a break than disappoint and fail someone whom believes in me so wholeheartedly, and knows how fast I can operate.

Sadly I’ve “shown my hand” this past year of what I’m capable of, but it’s unsustainable for my stress levels, needed downtime, and resetting ability. And more is desired. I’ve mentioned already to the boss that I’m burning the candle at both ends, but it’s only been sprinkled throughout the year. I also hate that I would them regret providing a large optional incentivized reward. Additionally if I fail it’s most likely no more of that and I would just be considered “middle of the road”. I’m OK with that if someone didn’t know my abilities, but again I have pushed past 120% capacity many times for tight deadlines and to get things done.

- How do I change my mindset to not care about disappointing 
- What, if anything, do I tell boss? I feel I need to drop hints that this is too much and if I’m dead it does no one good. ( absolutely sucks feeling capable but also having a hapicapied weakness of stress leading to depression.)
- What would you do if you were me with these concerns, and yet burned out?",Stress

Relationship with my (bipolar) girlfriend is on a mutually imposed hiatus because she wants to be alone a lot lately having started a new job after being out of work for over a year and a half needing to adjust I guess and me being someone that enjoys and needs affection. And two days ago my car broke down. Just came home from my work summer event (professional life is going great actually but atm I feel like I am just functioning). Came home and immediately grabbed my guitar and started playing and singing my soul out to the song ""Dead Flowers"" by the Rolling Stones (playing the Townes Van Zandt version). And then it happened. A genuine flashback. 4 years ago I was on a kind of soul searching trip in Vietnam. Sitting on a Rooftop in Hanoi I played guitar and sang by myself and this girl was watching me and after a brief moment of silence she looked me dead in the eye and said ""You sing when you are sad, do not you?"" And it hit me like a truck. I do not know why I am even posting this on here. I guess I juest need to vent. I really really hope that our hiatus will work out.

"Hello, new here Hello everyone, lurker for a small while now. I'm 24M.

I'm in the process of getting diagnosed, cause my life is shit and I continually fail at anything and have no friends and never had a romantic relationship. Everything points to AvPD according to the psychiatric place I'm being diagnosed in, so I figured I'd check out the sub some time ago. I resonate with a lot of people in here, so I felt like I'd chip in a bit.

I've essentially lived in complete isolation for 3-4 months now except to buy groceries (on sick leave from my vocational school), only very rarely seeing family in that time. All social interaction is through online games (not that this has ever really been much different), which I do think help ground me a bit more in reality. I know that some of you guys have gone years without even that, and I'm sorry to hear it. I want to get better, finish my education, have one or two friends, a Roma tic relationship and a job. But life is fucking hard and most of the time it feels like a fact that none of it will ever happen, seriously fuck living like this.

I'm getting a little hope from knowing more about AvPD and that I most likely am about to be diagnosed, so I can get help, but even still I've had times today where I just feel like human waste that shouldn't be allowed to exist. I'm scared of getting hurt so I've never attempted suicide, even though I've fantasized about it a lot. I also couldn't bring myself to do anything like it because of my family, sometimes they're all that holds me from crossing my fear.

"There's no amount of meds I can take that will properly medicate my overwhelming generalized anxiety without screwing everything else up It just feels cosmically unfair that the fact that I need to take multiple mood stabilizers seems to mean the balance is such that it's impossible for SSRIs to lessen very much of my anxiety. I've been seeing my pdoc for years and she's great and I trust her, and we spent two years figuring out the formula for my comorbid cocktail. Before I was diagnosed bipolar obvs life was miserable, but I was able to take a higher dosage of the SSRI I still take (Lexapro) and maybe I'm remembering with rose colored shades, but I feel like back then, while my life may have been spiraling out of control, the anxiety wasn't quite so paralyzing. We've tried multiple times to increase the Lexapro, but every time I become catatonically emotionless within the week, so I know at least for Lexapro that's not a viable option.
My pdoc seems to think that the anxiety is more situational than chemical, but I can't help but feel this isn't a normal (or completely unmedicateable) level of crippling anxiety to feel constantly. 
At the same time this isn't an ideal point in my life to go gambling with switching up my meds again. 
Is it really just impossible for some of us to find chemical relief from anxiety in a way that won't throw off the balance of the mood stabilizers? I know I should pursue DBT or CBT but $ makes that really difficult right now when I already pay my pdoc out of pocket and am broke as a joke. Is it pessimistic or deluded to think there's no way something other than medication could treat my anxiety the way meds did in the past? I know therapy could help with depression and such, but what of the every-second-of-everyday anxiety that is definitely not entirely situational and has not improved with changing situational circumstances? If the anxiety was caused by something specific I might be more optimistic about CBT/DBT, but it's just... generalized. It doesn't go away.

"Fear of getting confidence Lately i been watching youtube videos about assertiveness and confidence, but i feel like i can't put it in act, because i believe if i will start to get assertive i would end up in some conflict, so i get in a state of fear of my actions, lately i'm really confused about my behaviours, probably watching even more stuff makes me overthinking even more, i can't relax a bit when i'm outside, i focus only on my body language and i feel like i'm not real sometimes...

"how to gently ghost an avoidant without making feel them guilty? so, throwaway because i’m afraid she might be in this sub.
before asking the real question, long story short (tldr at the end):

so me (22m) and this girl (20f) matched on tinder a year ago, we want on a date and then she ghosted me the day after.
tried to talk to her one day after few months, got a single message reply and then she disappeared again.
at the end of last year i notice she was on hinge saying she broke up with her bf, so i started posting instagram stories that she might’ve been find interesting, and she started liking them, so after a while i reached out to her and wishing a happy new year. she seemed kinda interest, so we made plans for the following week.
she ghosted me again. i was disappointed.
after few days i noticed she had put me back in the close friends (she removed me from it after the first ghosting) so i thought “mh she might be to ashamed to write me back after all this time, i’ll reach out again” 
and since then we never stopped talking anymore, but here comes the problem.
we just talked for a couple months, i tried not to push anything to don’t let her make uncomfortable and run away again, but she basically is just venting on me, and now she started venting also about “male friends” on and on, so i got suspicious, and i was right, she’s back on hinge with a fresh new verified and recently active profile. 

now here comes the problem, and i don’t mean her being on hinge, at least not directly.
-she’s in therapy and on meds, i’m pretty sure her therapist wouldn’t suggest her to be on hinge (correct me if i’m wrong). 
-she said she couldn’t drink cause of meds and of med swings, but few days ago she started hanging out at night (she couldn’t do it before hanging out with me couple weeks ago) with “a male friend” and wanted to get drunk ( 🚩).
-she said she’s to anxious to hang out with people outta blue ( 🚩).
-we were talking about hanging out again, said she was super busy, got even more busy with college lessons, but she found the to hang out with somebody else, while i’m being her emotional support for the last 2-3 months 
-didn’t text me back for couple days after hanging out with that guy

so the real question is: how do i gently end up things with her? i don’t want to make feel her guilty, but i can’t keep stressing myself this much

i thought she’d made progress with her therapist, but apparently she isn’t doing much of what they says, so i think she might be helpless and toxic, and mostly we aren’t on the same page, i truly love her and i think she knows but she’s playing with me and using me just to vent and for not feeling completely lonely 

TLDR after being ghosted multiple times with a girl with avpd, adhd and probably bpd too (i’m referring what she said to me), we seemed to bond for once, but she might be a toxic person and i don’t think i don’t want keep pursuing this anymore , i’d like to slowly walk away without hurting both of us. 
she probably know i’m in love with her and she’s playing me. even if i’d come out and we’d make things work (quite impossible imho) i’m not sure she might be a good fit.

"I can't imagine what friendship would look like in my life I'm in my 40s now. The last time I had friends was in school. I'm not sure we would have been friends if the we hadn't been in the same environment day after day. Actually I'm pretty sure we wouldn't have been. My friends mostly were other people who didn't have other friends, i.e. other outsiders. 

We'd meet to play computer games, or sometimes (rarely) go swimming. But we never really talked about personal stuff. I'm not even sure this counts as friendship?

Anyway...so I've been without that kind of social connection for a long time now. Too busy struggling with education and work and health and life in general to engage in hobbies. 

I think I really have no idea what friendship is apart from seeing it on TV or remembering childhood friends. Is it more than spending time together and watching TV or engaging in hobbies together? Am I even capable of friendship?

Consequently, friendship isn't something I've been looking for. Maybe if I knew what I'm missing out on, I would?

"Restricting stressors on devices. help! Hi all, I thought this would be a good place to ask.

Sometimes its best for my stress and anxiety to flat out block apps and websites that cause me stress. I have a very bad habit of wanting to dig things up from the past, even if they would hurt me, and often times the best way for me to combat this is to restrict myself from accessing social media.

Right now I've been using an app called 'Freedom' which has been very useful. The issue? I've figured out how to disable it whenever I want. Knowing that at any point I could breach the restrictions I put in place just makes me super anxious. I'm able to go into the VPN settings and turn off 'connect on demand' which allows me to bypass the block.

Does anyone know any surefire way I can block things, and not have access to them? being able to set a block on social media for 24 hours is often the best way I can get back on track with my day, and stop stressing over digging up things that would hurt me.

I feel like I'm repeating the cycle that I went through. I completely avoid my younger brother and I've ruined our bond. He doesn't even look at me, and it's my fault because I wouldn't even look at him. I'm sure that hurt him.

It may not seem like it, but I do try and care about him. When he does look at me I try to make sure I smile. I know how important that is for children. When he asks for a hug I'll give it, even if I don't want to. When he wants to show me something I try to ask questions and give him praise for his creative works. 

I don't do this often enough though. I avoid him because I don't have much to give. Kids in general make me feel uneasy because they need so much from their caretakers, I feel inadequate that I can't give them that. He reminds me of myself when I was younger and it makes me uncomfortable, because I rejected that part myself a long time ago..

Kids are authentically themselves, until society molds them. I can already see it happening with him. He's quieter than he used to be. He doesn't look people in the eyes. He shuffles nervously.

"How to deal with in-person avoidance? Hi dear community!

I have a question, my partner has AVPD. We have been dating for some months.

And I noticed that when he’s going through an anxiety “episode” or moment. He sort of physically avoids me.

For example if he feels embarrassed, or has low self esteem particularly high that moment. He will “hide” behind his laptop, or walk behind or in front of me, distancing himself physically, while still being kind, it’s more of a way of hiding from me, when he can’t actually leave. (For example when we share a hotel room on vacation)

I did notice that when I grab his hand to hold mine while walking, that he does reciprocate(even when he tried to walk behind me or further away from me) but I’m not sure if he does it to please me but dislikes it, or if he likes it that I’m gently being reassuring and consistent.

And I'm realizing through a lot of questions that there are people I just don't actually like I'm surrounding myself with? Or people I want to interact with more that I know will make me happier compared to my current friend group.

But I can't help but think that anybody I would actually enjoy talking to couldnt possibly like me as a result. I think it's become a self-fulfilling prophecy. The more I criticise myself the more I pull back the less I interact with people and the world and the less 'worthy' I am. But the flavor of people I enjoy are the hardworking, driven nice ones. They wouldnt gossip about me behind my back, nobody cares enough to do that. But I would feel like such a charity case. When I'm doing okay it's okay.

Fear is a normal emotion that every human experiences when faced with physical or emotional threats. When a child rides a bicycle for the first time or when a fresher attends an interview or people go on a roller coaster, we are facing the fear of uncertainty.

"There are a number of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) techniques that I have found helpful for myself including Spielmans 3-P model, which helps explain depression and anxiety. It says that there are 3 main factors that come together to create a chronic illness (like depression or anxiety disorders). The first is predisposing factors. Predisposing factors are things like genetics or cultural/family attitudes and they are generally out of our control. Predisposing factors increase our chance of developing the symptoms of a chronic issue (if the other two factors are also present). The next is precipitating factors (or triggers) which lead to the manifestation of the symptoms (in your case maybe the panic attack at 13). Precipitating factors are usually traumatic experiences. In order for the illness to become chronic, there generally needs to be perpetuating factors as well. Perpetuating factors are thoughts or behaviors which often initially arose to help you cope with the symptoms, but now are causing the issue to continue. Behavioral activation is a specific type of CBT for depression that helps you identify what your perpetuating behaviors may be and take concrete steps to stop engaging in those behaviors. An example of one of my own perpetuating factors for depression was isolating myself/not leaving the house. In many cases this urge to isolate arose out of mental fatigue or to avoid anxiety provoking situations. But in the long run, too much isolation worsened my depression because I ended up cutting myself off from the people, activities, and outside information (outside of my own brain) that helped me regulate my emotions and feel more pleasure/joy. Changing a perpetuating behavior once you have identified it takes patience and coping skills. Coping skills help you cope with the uncomfortable emotions that come up in a way that does not perpetuate the problem. It was hard for me to get myself to do the therapy (especially in the beginning) but I can tell it has really rewired my brain in a way that makes life feel more pleasant. I am sorry about your suffering and I hope you find a way to feel better soon. CBT principles that I have found helpful",Depression

"Anyone else lie as a child? Not sure if it’s an AVPD thing, but growing up I told a string of lies to all of my (very few) friends. It weighs on me almost daily. Some were *really* horrible, like going blind by 30 or refusing to help my cousin during an overdose as a child. Of course that’s not real. I can’t believe I said those things to people, but it felt like the only way at the time.

Through a lot of reflection, I realized that I expected rejection and wanted to control it. I wanted to make them see me as a bad person, because I didn’t deserve them. But nothing in my life (that I understood at the time) was damaging enough to cause these problems. My family taught to me early on that if you’re not doing hard drugs or jumping off the bridge, it’s not a valid mental health condition. I didn’t think I had any reason to have the problems I did, so I had to give people ‘fake reasons’ to make them believe it, because my parents told me that’s the only way.

Also somewhat of a test, like if they stay for this horrible person I’m pretending to be, they’ll surely stick around for who I actually am if that’s better. And it’s not hard to be better than that, given the severity of the lies I told. If they leave, then I’ll have been in control of the rejection.

"small victories I’ve been secretly struggling with avpd for years, I couldn’t even tell you when it began. What I do know is- it started out as severe social anxiety and has gotten progressively worse as times passed. I have panic attacks/trouble sleeping nearly every day and feel like I’m incapable of doing anything 99% of the time. I’ve never told anyone about my struggles. Today I started online college and signed up for betterhelp therapy through my school. I’m absolutely terrified for this journey but I’m proud of myself for pushing myself to get here. As someone who’s struggled to commit to a career/obligations and take initiative with anything- this is huge for me.

I just want a break from my life and the ability to get out of this mindset or at least prevent it from getting worse. At a hospital, there would be people to help me get better and keep me busy, so I think a mental hospital is the best option.

I have been taking lexapro for three years, b/c previous therapists diagnosed anxiety disorder. So currently, i have a lot of mania, but very little depression. and the mania doesn't seem too extreme - my therapist thought it was BP 2 but the psych testing came back BP 1, which she agrees with now. I have thought I was the second coming on occasions, that's probably the most manic idea i've had. I have a good career, have always done well in the workplace. I am a mom and wife, and my family loves me. So I really hesitate to medicate. But I also wonder if I should keep taking Lexapro? My therapist said withdrawl from that is ugly, so she doesn't recommend it. But maybe it's been triggering my mania?

"Anxiety spiking after starting fluoxetine (Prozac) Hello all! I’m new here. I recently decided to take a break from a problematic drinking habit and found that I had been self medicating for anxiety more than I realized, as it sprang back with a fury.

"Dealing with ALS Anxiety Hi All,

This is my first post here, but I've found the content extremely helpful as I've tried to manage my anxiety about ALS for the last week or so. 

I'm a 30 year old male, in what I would consider very good health, but since an incident 2 weeks ago I've had extreme and debilitating health anxiety about having terminal cancer or ALS. 

It started with numbness and tingling in my feet, legs, and eventually groin after watching a live basketball game in an uncomfortable chair. I was already worried due to a urinary issue that started a week before this incident (and has since resolved) so I think I was a bit more on edge than normal. 

Anyway, since this event I've had the perception of weakness in my body and the feeling comes and goes. I don't have any evidence of actual weakness, but when I think about lifting weights I dont think I can lift the same amount that I'm used to. As a result, I'm compelled to do strength tests with objects around me. It's a nightmare. 

To make matters worse my thumb on my left hand had been twitching slightly for 2 days now. I can see a visible pulsation in my hand near the base of my thumb and hand. I'm thinking my thumb may be twitching as a result of whatever artery/vein is there, but I'm really scared.

"Coping methods you use? (venting) I was finally approved and am able to afford health care and I scheduled an appointment for the GP and the Dentist because of a small bump I have sort of under/in front of my ear by my lower jaw on the right side.

But I am sort of terrified, and am obviously fearing the worst, I just wanted to know what coping methods you have. 

Bleh. I'm sorry I need to vent a little too. I've always had one tonsil larger than the other on the right side too, and I like freaked out about it when I was 15 or 16, but it never grew or anything. I've had jaw pain on and off for a few years I think mostly when my wisdom teeth started growing in. I also get earaches, tinnitus, and jaw popping (again mostly on my right side). I know this sounds like tmj, but now I found this bump and I am just terrified the bump has been something more sinister, and I could never afford to do anything about it, and I am just ashamed of myself. 

Also like I need to get work done on my teeth, and I am just a mess. I am happy I got insurance finally so I can see a doctor and maybe a therapist tbh. Bleh.

"Is it okay to appear rude to others? I find it extremely anxiety inducing to be disliked, and appearing rude or non caring elicits this reaction from others.

The funny thing is, I am continually, day after day, in my attempts not to appear this way, am this way. I don't give solid eye contact to others, mere glances, I hide myself away in plain sight with poor, meek body language, I carry myself without confidence to avoid interactions.

All in vain attempts of appearing, in my delusional mind, 'nice'. It is so self destructive, you essentially let people walk over you, ignore you, in some desire to be liked. By people who dislike you, will come to dislike you as a result of your behaviours, or simply horrible people who you wouldn't want to like you. 

Let me give an example, of what I'm thinking. 

You're shopping for groceries, you want to look at a shelf which is currently occupied by someone else, you need something on that shelf, like a tin of food or something. Usually I will see this and think 'oh my god, don't want them to know I need something there' heavens forbid if they see me, what will they think? So I quickly change direction and pretend to look at other items until they move.
So, instead, why not stand in their shadow, and wait patiently, let your presence be seen, in an ideal world, ask them to make space if you know exactly what you need but that would come when you're more confident? So yes, stand next to them, and don't budge, just let them know non verbally, you're waiting.

Another example, you're at the cashier, they're doing your items, I always look everywhere but where I need to look, I lose focus on what I should be looking at, which is the items I'm paying for, the cashiers eyes in case they're trying to communicate something. And what if they say something, small talk for instance, well maybe I'm not in the mood to pursue further small talk, so why not just give closed answers, why do I feel the need to fill the silences, to say whatever I can to appear 'normal'. I come across as flustered, shy, unconfident, I see it in their faces, they see the fear, they see the disgust on my face believing I'm a wrongin or something but it's really just negativity brewing inside of me of being in such a anxiety inducing situation that causes these expressions on my face, then they mirror it. And I think awful things about myself. 
So why not stay calmer, speak slower, not try and have a positive small talk experience, just take things at my own pace. Otherwise I leave feeling utterly embarrassed, ashamed, and the next time I shop there and there my cashier they're going to hate that I'm there. As opposed to being more stoic and less nervously chatty.

I'm rambling a bit, losing focus on my words, sorry but some of that probably doesn't make sense. I hope you get the type of rude I'm talking about. It's not purposefully being rude. It's more, being true to yourself, being comfortable in your own body and standing up to be counted as an equal. Something I avoid.

Also he mentioned that I do have some symptoms of schizophrenia and narcissistic personality. But after I read his diagnosis this evening, he wrote that I have ‘Other personality disorder’.

"Substituting Geodon for Indica Strains Hello, 

       I am currently on 125mg Lamictal when i wake up then 40mg Geodon before bed.

 I have gone from 240lbs (lithium as mood stabilizer) to instead 215lbs on lamictal (mood stabilizer). So, in trying to get back to the weight I was before medication, 180lbs, I will experiment if Indica Cannibis can produce similar, or better, sleep effects as Geodon. 

If anyone has tried or is in a state where they can try please comment.

My guess is a couple hits off a indica was vape pen and a small edible and you will be counting sheep within an hour. 

Keep in mind I will be continuing on the Lamictal mood stabilizer (studied to cause weight loss) and only seek to eliminate/lessen my dosage of Geodon (said to have low risk of weight gain, which for me is 45 pounds). 


Thanks for reading

Also, I have tried up too 200 mg of CBD oil which was advertised as a alternative for anti psychotics with no success. When i took them in place of the Geodon I would only nap for a few hours in what felt like a shallow, half awake sleep. I would not recommend spending 80 dollars on a 30, 30mg capsules from Wildflower CBD.com (which was recommended by high times so i assume it is legit) they simply do not help you stay asleep. 

I would try the indica strain canabis for myself but live in a state that is dragging their heels with there medical Marijuana program.

"Health anxiety makes everyday tasks so difficult Some background about my health anxiety history - I’ve had severe health anxiety intermittently since my teens.  Most often I am preoccupied with my heart.  My heart rate has always jumped up quickly (~180ish bpm) with minimal exercise or even at times of rest, but my resting heart rate is usually 45-55 bpm.  I mention numbers just because my heart rate is a little atypical-but I have been checked out by cardiologists so many times over the past 15 years, always with the reassurance that I am fine. Most recently, this past summer I wore a 30 day holter monitor where they would measure my episodes of high heart rate. They also did a stress test, numerous ekgs, etc. They confirmed I had periods of sinus tachycardia, but it was normal rhythm and said I was healthy.  They said the heart was appropriately responding and was likely beating fast because of anxiety (which I don’t think is the whole story, I think I have a food allergy which can trigger it, but that’s beside the point.). They gave me a low dose of beta blockers to take as needed for comfort/anxiety, but promised I wouldn’t have a heart attack, with or without the pills.  

Anyways, to bring my story to today, I’ve been putting off doing laundry for far too long.  Im embarrassed to admit I have been buying new clothes to prolong my laundry chore. The issue is in my apartment I have to carry my laundry down a few flights of stairs, outside and into another building. After it’s clean I have to carry it again outside and then up a few flights of stairs. The laundry basket is heavy and my heart races so fast when I do this, and I panic. 

I just did a load and I could feel my heart beating out of my chest. I sat down with a glass of water and within 60 seconds my heart rate was back in the 70s. I remind myself that my stress test was normal, even when they brought my heart rate to 190 for several minutes. But I am still so freaked out. I have several more loads to do and I’m so afraid.

I know part of the answer is that I am incredibly out of shape and weak. This is not coincidence -I am extremely avoidant of anything that raises my heart rate , and am terrified of exercising.  I stopped wearing my Fitbit a few months ago (at the urging of my therapist) because I obsessively measured my heart rate and was even afraid of standing up/walking - I believed if my heart rate went above 80 it would trigger a heart attack.  Taking off my Fitbit was one of the scariest things I’ve done but now that it’s been a few months I feel SO much better.  I do my best not to measure heart rate now and have been going on more walks, but lifting anything makes me feel my heart rate and I can’t ignore it.   I just feel so stuck and like I can’t keep up with basic chores.  I feel like a failure of an adult. 

I don’t know what I’m asking for, this is mostly a rant. I’ve been lurking this subreddit for months and it’s brought me a lot of comfort.  Health anxiety is such a difficult illness but this community helps me feel less alone.

TLDR: my health anxiety is about my heart rate/heart attacks. Basic chores like laundry elevate my heart rate and cause panic and avoidance. Feel like I can’t keep up with life. ",Anxiety

"finally got up the courage to go to the Psychiatrist. I'd been hesitant.. scared.. wary.. about going before. Thoughts racing through my head of what a diagnosis would mean for me. My pdoc didn't feel comfortable giving me a diagnosis for anything other than general anxiety/depression, and recommended I go to a specialist so I could get more accurate treatment. Took me well over a year to finally go. I'd made appointments and blew them off , never actually going. I'm so glad I did now.


I had to get over the fact that I would get diagnosed with 'something' and it would be on my medical records. I guess I had some preconceived notion that it would never go away and there would be some sort of stigma attached to me everywhere I go. Irrational as that may sound, it is what prevented me from seeking professional help.


I finally went this past Monday, spent an hour with a P.A. talking about my history, what meds I am currently on (Lexapro/Wellbutrin from my pdoc), etc. She took that information and talked to one of their head Psychiatrists about it, then came back about 15 minutes later with him. He was very nice, understanding, and seemed genuinely interested and concerned about my care. My personal research proved to be right. I have Bipolar II. I felt an inner sense of calmness and clarity now that I had a professional, someone that has spent their life studying conditions such as this, verifying that yes indeed, there was something amiss in my brain. And that better help was coming.


Lexapro had been working WONDERS for my anxiety and slightly for depression as well. Wellbutrin didn't seem to do much, but made life ""liveable"". I was not thriving or excited about anything. Just going through the motions.


He took me off Wellbutrin and replaced it with a mood stabilizer, Trileptal. I stopped the Wellbutrin cold turkey and started Trileptal that same night. I had a really good Tuesday and today is looking great as well. 


I feel much better now that I was finally able to get over myself and get proper help, and hopefully better meds to balance my moods. I have a follow up appointment in 2 weeks. By then I hope to see even more positive changes with the Trileptal.


I also chose to stop drinking cold turkey as well. I knew I had been drinking too much for too long. Each time I drank it was 6+ beers, and sometimes 4-5 nights a week. It became routine. A way to quell my mind at the end of the night. To slow the racing thoughts. It took the words from the Psychiatrist to really cement it in my brain that alcohol counteracts anti depressants and that in order to feel better, I would need to make a lifestyle change. He said the Trileptal would assist in those nighttime racing thoughts.


I even stopped smoking cannabis. This happened after I started the Wellbutrin. I think that can be attributed to the fact that Wellbutrin is somewhat of a cessation tool used for people quitting cigarettes. The urge or desire to smoke (which used to be daily) just stopped. I don't care anymore. It doesn't really do anything for me. Even with my MMJ card and specific strains, all it really did was numb me and slow my brain down (again like with Alcohol to slow the racing thoughts). So without the alcohol and cannabis, I feel strongly that I can finally let my mind be a blank slate for the psych meds to work properly and not be counteracted or made less effective by other psychoactive chemicals.


I am committed to feeling better, and if drinking La Croix instead of beer helps in any way, I'm all for it. I want to be able to let the meds do their job in the most effective manner.

"Bad inpatient stories? I’ve been hospitalized twice as a teenager in a youth ward and twice as an adult. The last time was at Fairfax Behavioral Hospital in Kirkland, WA and it was abusive as hell. Everything about why I was there was horribly exaggerated, and they lied about me when I went to court so I got legally committed to two weeks unless a doctor signed me out. They literally said because I took so long with the strip search (because I’ve been raped quite a few times but you know, they didn’t mention that part), that I couldn’t handle interacting with anyone right now and I was still obviously in an extreme crisis and I might injure someone else. I wasn’t even in an episode lmao, I was fine after two days of being there, and I’ve never been a violent person? But go off I guess. A lot of other shitty things happened and they got my hopes up and said I could leave one day, but then they were like “nah you’re gonna stay for another few days for no reason” I told them it’s illegal to hold me when I’m not in a crisis and they were like “haha ok try to leave then”. When it was my day to leave, my case worker “lost” necessary paperwork and then went on a two hour lunch and my psychiatrist “didn’t have time to write my prescriptions”. I ended up leaving the facility at 7pm when my exit time was 2:30pm.

"How to deal with in-person avoidance? Hi dear community!

I have a question, my partner has AVPD. We have been dating for some months.

And I noticed that when he’s going through an anxiety “episode” or moment. He sort of physically avoids me.

For example if he feels embarrassed, or has low self esteem particularly high that moment. He will “hide” behind his laptop, or walk behind or in front of me, distancing himself physically, while still being kind, it’s more of a way of hiding from me, when he can’t actually leave. (For example when we share a hotel room on vacation)

I did notice that when I grab his hand to hold mine while walking, that he does reciprocate(even when he tried to walk behind me or further away from me) but I’m not sure if he does it to please me but dislikes it, or if he likes it that I’m gently being reassuring and consistent.


My dear Avpd-Ers- when feeling low, do you like being comforted, or do you truly want someone to take distance and leave you alone? I just want to learn how to handle the situation so he feels comfortable!

Thanks everyone !!",Personality disorder
"I've been making a fool of myself for the past month This is going to be long, sorry. I just really wanted to let this all out and I figured this is the best place to do it.

I've always had a little bit of health anxiety, but it typically subsided very quickly. It was never something that had an effect on my life until recently.

One night in early December I was playing a video game for several hours and barely moved. Eventually I had a pain shooting up my left leg and it appeared to be swollen. My mom suggested I pinched a nerve, but I just knew it was a blood clot. My symptoms were a mild pain in my leg and ""swelling"", Google told me I was about to die, and I was thoroughly convinced.

A few days pass of me obsessing over this. I read about DVT for hours every single day. I'm basically an expert on it at this point. I know all about taking blood thinners and the effect it could have on your period. I was preparing myself for this life.

I measured my legs to compare them many times a day. This had me believing the ""swelling"" wasn't going down. Turns out the left side of me is just fatter than the other half and I never noticed it because the difference is literally less than a cm. Was I *ever* swelling? No idea. My mom measured her own legs to show me a difference in the size of your legs was normal, which only kind of comforted me. Briefly wondered if she too was dying and didn't know it.

Somewhere around this time I thought I had sleep apnea because one night my anxiety was so bad that I was jolting awake every time I started dozing off. This fear faded pretty quickly since my obvious blood clot was my biggest priority.

After those few days passed, my anxiety finally won the battle, and I went to the ER. Shocking news: I did not have a blood clot in my leg. I thought this confirmation would make me feel better, and it did for a few days. But my (mild, barely noticeable) leg pain persisted and after all my DVT research I decided I was among the extremely rare few who had an inaccurate ultrasound reading.

6 days after the first ER visit, I had an excruciating muscle spasm in my leg. Surely the blood clot has moved up into my thigh, I thought. This was accompanied by my lower back feeling like it was on fire and the fiery pain radiating down into my leg. My mom once again suggested a pinched nerve. I was in hysterics at this point so I ignored her and went back to the ER.

They did another ultrasound. It was negative. I had sciatica. Started googling that to make sure it could cause the symptoms I had (it can). The pain was goddamn miserable, but I wasn't going to die.

You'd think at this point I'd be good, but my mind had other plans. I developed a cough. Welp, the blood clot was real and must have traveled to my lungs. I'm dealing with a pulmonary embolism now and death is imminent. I believed this for a few days before finally accepting that it was fucking ridiculous.

So after about 3 weeks of this hell I finally moved on from my blood clot obsession and just focused on healing the sciatica. Had a nice 2 weeks or so of feeling like I was back to normal mentally, until this week.

I had a pain in my lower abdomen. Convinced myself it was a kidney infection. Didn't start off assuming a mostly harmless UTI (or literally any of the many other things that could cause abdominal pain), nah, I went right for the hard hitter. This one could kill me, it's gotta be that one. I considered appendicitis too.

It was constipation.

I was hopeful that my life would go back to normal after the whole blood clot disaster, but now I'm worried that it was just the beginning. I *knew* I was being ridiculous when I diagnosed myself with a kidney infection, but there was still that voice in the back of my head saying ""but what if..."". I was still researching, still getting worked up about it. I don't want to be like this. It's humiliating and exhausting.",Anxiety

She shared she had social anxiety. She knew I had generalized anxiety, but that has improved greatly for me now. That was the extend of us knowing about each other's problems. She decided me having anxiety equated to me being a negative person and that is actually not true. She doesn't even know me well enough to determine what kind of person I am so that is part of what upset me. The other part is just the way she went about the situation. I have zero interest in ever reconnecting with her. The trust wouldn't be there and I'd always be fearful of saying something wrong or of being hurt again.

The conversation continues but at this time the symptoms I have been worried about begin to appear, my ears turn red, my lips start to shake, my thinking start to prepare for the impending possibility of having a panic attack while at the same time I start observing that the person I am talking to has now noticed that I am having a reaction. My voice start to tremble as I must make some type of escape. 

Shame overtakes me as I now know that the other person knows that something just went wrong. I abruptly end the conversation and remove myself now completely drained and knowing that in future conversations with that person, this previous terrible episode will be the thing in my head and wondering if it will also be in their head. 

Later on as days pass, I start noticing that the other person also becomes uncomfortable and looks anxious when talking to me but seems happy and relaxed when talking to other people. 

After sometime, I start avoiding them because it takes a toll on me. If it is a place of employment, over time I will have many of such episodes with different people and it becomes too much so I quit so I can start fresh somewhere else but I already know what the outcome will be at each new place. 

I am 56 and have been like that since High School. 

Some medications have helped, particularly Effexor. Also thinking about my lungs breathing and doing mindfulness while conversing have reduced it tremendously, but many times I forget to do the work and I get the episodes.

"Health Anxiety This past few months I’ve had a set of symptoms that have had me worried that I have a neurological disorder. I am wondering if these symptoms could be caused by stress, and if anyone here has had similar symptoms they know to be caused by stress.

A little context, I recently got accepted into my dream job. The only hitch is that it has intense training for six months, where if you fail a test at any point you are dismissed. The material we are required to study is immense in volume and the tests are close to twice a week.

In the month leading up to the course I found myself experiencing a small head fog. It developed more and more over the weeks into the worst head fog of my life. I could barely think and always felt a sort of pressure in my head. Math I would normally fly through was difficult and even just simple thoughts were hard to get out sometimes. As the course started my vision started to feel off, not quite sure if it was/is double or blurry as it’s not that bad, but I can tell it’s off. My eyes also got super sore for a week or so. About a week ago I also started to feel my left jaw and arm go a bit numb/tingly. It’s mostly there but comes and goes in intensity. 

Since the head fog I have been chronically online in search of answers which has lead me down every rabbit hole. I am frightened i have something like MS, and though I know my research into it along with my stress with my course is more likely to blame, I can’t help but doubt that stress alone could give me blurry vision, numb arm/face, and immense brain fog

I would really appreciate anyone’s experience with stress, ms, or related symptoms.

Thanks all",Anxiety

"Health effects of long-term (&gt;6 years) use of lamotrigine? (Particularly related to chronic inflammation and low-grade flu-like symptoms) Hi all,

I've been on 250mg lamotrigine for about 6 years now. It works fantastically. However, during the same period I've slowly developed a kind of background inflammation that's basically the same as very minor flu. It's there almost all the time - some days better than others - and is sometimes accompanied by muscle aches/sprains and a slightly sore throat. I also feel like I'm extra warm to the touch.

No doubt the timing is purely coincidental and I have some other problem, but I figured it was worth researching. Unfortunately, however, I can't find much about long-term usage and the only articles that refer to those symptoms are acute allergic responses.

"Lets lose the fears  

Fear is a normal emotion that every human experiences when faced with physical or emotional threats. When a child rides a bicycle for the first time or when a fresher attends an interview or people go on a roller coaster, we are facing the fear of uncertainty. But when these emotions become intense or prolonged disturbing our thoughts and actions, it becomes anxiety. Then we need to take steps to overcome it.

"The last time I made a real friend was in the 1st grade. I do not mean irl, either. I mean a friend as in someone I can be myself around and feel that they want to keep engaging with me. The last of my real friendships fizzled out before I was 15. I grew up sheltered from the hardships of life, but at the same time, I was stunted from growth because the only person I could learn from was an abusive alcoholic older brother. He kept me alive, but prevented me from learning how to be normal. So I retreated as far as I could, to the point where it got physical. In the last years of middle school, I stopped applying myself in school, doing nothing with my time except reading or being absent-minded. After my first year of highschool, at the age of 17, I ran away. I took a bus to my hometown and tried to reconnect with old friends. I had fun for a few months, and I learned a lot of essential things both about myself and about the real world. Then, as suddenly as it began, it ended. I had burned any bridge that could keep me where I wanted to be.I called my brother, begged forgiveness, and came back to him. He had not changed at all. It clashed violently with my newfound outlook on life, and his abuse reached an all-time high for the remainder of my 17th and 18th years on Earth. My depression came back, but I did not retreat. I fought back, mentally and physically. Eventually the abuse stopped completely. I do not know why really. But I was left in a position where my brother was my life-source, and at the same time, I did everything in my power to not engage with him.I am 23 now. I have been in the same position since then. In the handful of years past, I have tried to spark relationships with other people. Both irl and online, platonic and romantic. However, I cannot make anything work. I am fundamentally broken with no fix in sight. The only person who has expressed a want to help me is my little sister, and I cannot even bring myself to tell her what is wrong with me. I cannot fucking talk to people. I cannot look people in the eyes. I cannot feel empathy. I write this with the full expectation that it will gather no attention. I have a burn in my mind.

"Who is my first love? Have I fallen in love yet? As someone with AVPD, I have trouble connecting with people. I know I'm smart, and attractive, and I care for people, but it's my lack of social skills that make it hard for people to see the real me. I've had two guys like me back in the past few years. Which one of them would be considered my ""first love""?

The first guy ""Dave"" I met when I was 19 on vacation. He and I would just talk at the pool about politics and education (even though he was kind of a party guy, he has a nerdy side). We only hung out for two days, but after our first day hanging out, the second day, he was really shy talking to me. But our romance was cut short because he had a girlfriend, and made the mistake of spilling the beans about his crush on me to other kids at the resort. He cut off contact with me, but when they broke up a month later, he started looking at my social media a lot. Not to mention, he made a playlist about me for my birthday. We don't even talk, so I don't know if this is some sort of peace offering or apology. 

The second guy ""Steve"" I met a year later, at my job. He and I bonded on the first day of work about growing up in the same hometown, and I told my mom that day about how we bonded over our ""parallel lives"". We worked together for a little over a year. And we never went out or anything, but he would hit on me a lot. But stupid me was either too dense to realize he was flirting or too surprised in the moment to say any good flirting lines back. But a customer asked me for my number one day, and I gave it to him. I guess I kind of wanted to motivate my crush to ask me out, but literally the week after, he went out with his sister's friend (the sister set them up), but they broke up and he likes me.

"I got an aneurysm and i'm still alive I feel the need to add a trigger warning to this post. As someone who suffers from HA, I know this post can be scary but if I can be positive about it, you all can! I was diagnosed with brain aneurysm and artery dissections when I was 22, which put me at stroke risk until I was fully healed (which I am now). I will post the full story in the comments.

It seems that for some of you on here, that is literally your worst fear, I'm here to tell you that even if it does happen, an aneurysm or even a stroke is not a death sentence. In fact, I was healed (with no surgery) within 3 months.  The aneurysm had been there for at least 2 months before that and I had no idea, AND I STILL LIVED! The most debilitating part of this? The HA I got from it. It was the darkest 6 months of my life. I was in constant fear of having a stroke despite the blood thinners I was on. I never wanted to be alone anywhere and only felt truly safe with my parents. I had panic attacks all the time. But slowly, I gained more confidence in the functioning abilities of my body. I can honestly say that the HA affected me way more than the neurological symptoms did. So give your bodies more credit and your anxious brains less credit! 

If I can survive an aneurysm and torn artery and only have bits of HA after 2 years, so can you!!

"Is anyone else's anxiety fueling your depression because nothing seems to work? Everyone says try drinking more water. Doesn't work. Try changing your diet. Doesn't work. Deep breathing exercises?

I have an important deadline of December this year, and there is no way I will be able to pull myself together to produce work of my normal standard. So, I have failed that too. I am just really fucking done. The antidepressants and the therapy have not touched it. I am still trapped in the prison of my own dark brain.

As a result I had a total burn out. Many months ago the situation with my abuser came up between this friend and I. I explained some stuff but she said it was too overwhelming for her to hear so I never brought it up again. My response to her saying I do nothing was just explaining that I don’t tell people why I’m in this situation because it scares people. It’s often retraumatizing when I tell people and their reaction is either to get scared and shut me down or not believe me at all. Her response was that a lot of people have f’d up things they have to deal with but they still have to do stuff.,Stress

"Just Diagnosed today Hi, first post to this Sub. 

(If anything I say is not allowed please let me know in a message even if you do remove the post so I can be more mindful in the future)

Kinda nervous moving forward but today I finally went to a Psych and after about an hour of talking about different thing's she settled upon one sure for diagnoses of BP2 and immediately prescribed Latuda 20mg at night during dinner. I had spoken with a therapist years ago and was on Trintellix and also tried Zoloft which did nothing but give me headaches and the other made me rage out (respectively). I found out many of the things I do in my daily life are actually Symptoms of both Mania and Depression and that I'm going through episodes of both Multiple times a day for the past 4 years that we covered.

I also have Chrons disease and I saw how it can affect weight and appetite, so I'm hopeful it can boost that as well as get my Racing thoughts, Insomnia and Hyper Productivity to a normal/manageable level. Im very leery about taking it with the experiences I've had with antipsychotics in the past, but my Dr also works with my wife who is ADHD and BP2, and I've seen how our Dr has helped her by listening to her and not just her diagnosis.

I'm on a Month trial at the 20mg so hopefully no severe side effects or medication interactions and this does what it needs to. And I apologize ahead of time to those on this Sub, I will most likely be spam reading a lot of your posts in the coming days just to understand different perspectives of this, cause I won't say I love it but I have a special thing about researching all I can about new things, especially medical.

"Stress hives from work. I want to preface this post with that in theory I love my job. Back in August I found a job that I actually enjoy doing, but my coworkers are stressing me out so horribly that I have allergic reaction like hives on the right side of my face and neck. 
I work at a gym in the daycare center and as of late we’ve been getting an influx of gym members, which in turn means more children.  At my gym we have two different rooms for childcare. We have a childcare room for toddlers (where I work) and then we have “kids club” for elementary school age kids. There is more than the age difference between the two rooms. Kids club is a much larger room and has more mature toys such as monster high dolls, Jenga, and a giant connect four. This room is better equipped for a larger group of kids. The other room is basically a glorified supply closet which is perfect for small children. 
Now we got that out of the way I can get to why I’m here: 
Between these two room there is supposed to be two people working, one in child care and one in kid’s club, but as of late I’ve been the only person scheduled for any form of daycare. It’s  been extremely difficult to manage the toddlers and making sure the older kids are okay.

I'm looking for knowledge/resources on how to help and be a support system for my girlfriend.

She let me know beforehand that she was bipolar and gave me opportunities to not pursue a relationship with her. I really care about her so I let her know I appreciate it but that I'd really like to build something with her.

Most recently she lost her meds when I was visiting and it totally shook her. One night she started to have a manic episode (Idk what the correct term is) and she was crying and laughing and rolling around on the bed.

I tried to comfort her but honestly I had no clue what to do. She couldn't talk after a point and was texting me saying it felt like if she talked that she'd completely lose it. She needed me to leave so I left but I felt scared and awful that I couldn't do anything for her. I didn't want to leave also because I was worried about possible suicidal tendencies.

I feel like this is something I'll have to talk to her more about, but atm she isn't ready to open up about the topic, and I don't want to force the issue just yet.

I'm stuck in between wanting to give her the space she needs, and wanting to do everything I can to become the support system she needs. I don't feel her family provides her with it.

"suspecting avpd hi. i suspect i may have avpd, or something related to it. i’d like to preface this post by saying that i started reading up on this disorder about an hour ago, so clearly i’m not going to jump to any conclusions here, or at least i’m not trying to. i just think it’s possible. i also have adhd and i’m on a waitlist to be tested for autism. if that helps.
 
i’ve struggled with severe anxiety issues for years. almost all of them are related to how people are perceiving me—i have intense anticipatory/perfomance anxiety; i fear that people are either going to think i act strangely, think i’m stupid/incompetent, or both, which will lead to a general dislike. this fear has grown so large i assume most new people i come in contact with dislike me, think i’m odd, and talk behind my back. it got so bad that i dropped out of high school and haven’t been able to hold a job, since i get overwhelmed very easily (a combination of aforementioned fears and sensory overload). i’ve been unemployed for a long while because the idea of even searching for or applying to jobs sounds hopeless, and it’s ruining my life. i always wanted to go to college growing up, but i’m frozen with fear and unable to attempt going. 
 
i fear that even people very close to me that i’ve been friends with for years are talking behind my back, and they don’t really want me around. i love interacting with people (for example my mutuals on social media sites) but i become fearful when they get closer to me and we interact more often, because i’m afraid that they won’t actually like me if we chat one on one, i won’t fit into their group of friends, they’re just pretending to like me, they’ll think i’m stupid, etc etc. i have such an intense fear of rejection at every turn, oftentimes hitting hard enough to feel physically painful. 
 
i’m doubtful, because sometimes i can talk to people fine. the fear is in the back of my mind, and sometimes it presents itself far more plainly, but other times i don’t have any issues interacting with people. talking to new people is also way easier, since it’d be far more upsetting if someone i’m already attached to decided they didn’t like me and abandoned me. 
 
i also identify with borderline symptoms, yet i constantly fear they’re not severe enough; i would fall into the ‘quiet bpd’ subtype. i rarely lash out. i isolate myself and agonize over my interpersonal relationships and the state of my life. 
 
sorry for the oversharing. i can elaborate or answer any questions. just please let me know what you think. anything is helpful.

"My entire life has spontaneously combusted over the last couple of months. A 7-year relationship that I moved across the country for four years ago ended suddenly. My ex-partner, my best friend in the world, within a month of our breakup, started dating a mutual friend who has spent the entirety of the pandemic harassing, bullying, manipulating, and gaslighting our friends -- conveniently, everyone but my partner. She has been aware of this, to the extent that I have been comfortable confiding in her, because this friend has been making many of us feel like *garbage*. Meanwhile she is only gotten closer to them as they have driven a wedge between themselves and the rest of us, and the way she describes them is exactly the opposite of how the rest of us experience them; she excuses their behavior easily with things they have told her, but she does not see how a million separate excuses for individual examples of horrible behavior add up to a really ugly picture of a pathological liar and manipulator.And now, suddenly within a month of our breakup, they are fucking. Meanwhile I am trying and failing to find a place to live and a place to work. My best lead on an apartment right now needs me to have a job (I was high risk for covid and went on unemployment and have been struggling to find work), I finally gave up after getting absolutely no responses and applied at a cafe my friend works at, lowering my standards down to the fucking floor. But the commute there is an hour both ways by bus (despite being a 15-minute drive).I am going to end up in an apartment alone (which scares me; I have been depressed my whole life and have a LOT of trouble with it when I am by myself, I cannot do any repetitive tasks without someone to talk to without cycling through suicidal thoughts even at the best of times), without my cat (she is taking the cat because she can afford to, I cannot), losing my insurance (when I left my job due to the pandemic our domestic partnership let me be added to hers) and thus losing my therapist (who was out of network for months, who I would been paying out of pocket for the whole time, $175 per week which I could not afford, who was FINALLY very recently paneled by my insurance and was added to it), just as I am finally coming to terms with a lot of the gender issues and dysphoria I have dealt with my entire life (which my partner helped me through a lot of, and I was just, finally sitting on the precipice of a lot of positive change).Even after we broke up, she wanted to keep living with me. We found a perfect place. We applied, got accepted, they wrote the lease, sent it to us, and *then* she decided she wanted to live alone. She started spending more time with our abusive friend. They started dating, which is an *insane* rebound (less than a month after the end of a 7-year relationship?) and just... extremely insensitive to me (generally I find it shitty to date within a friend group, but to date a friend's recent long-term ex is about a thousand steps too far), and she even realizes this. She told me that, yeah, it was shitty. But she needed to do something for herself, to make herself happy.I am depressed. I have a low opinion of myself. I have a habit of telling myself that I deserve bad things. But I did not deserve *that*. I know I did not. *I am still living with my ex because we are still on this lease; they could not even wait until we lived separately*.I was in a horrible pit of depression during the pandemic. Shit kept going wrong. My mom attempted suicide right beforehand, it started right when I almost landed a new job, then George Floyd and protests and wildfires and a thousand things, and I just sort of shut down due to depression. She felt like she was carrying the weight for both of us. Which is fair. I wish I would been more... conscious, I guess.But to do something so immediate, so callous, so thoughtless, and then to tell me to my face that she recognizes that it is shitty but she does not care, *and* that she wants us to still be best friends despite it.She knows how I feel about them, has for a long time. she is always been my best friend, and I confided in her when I was afraid and confused and did not yet know the rest of our friends were experiencing the same thing. She knows how they have hurt me, hurt our other friends. She just keeps repeating the excuses they have given her.I am going to be stuck in a shitty job with two hours of commuting each day. I am going to be stuck alone in an apartment. I am not going to have the mental energy to do things I want to do: I had just outlined most of a novel series, I was ready to start writing it right before the breakup; I will not have the mental capacity or time to find another fucking job. I had just been grappling with this gender dysphoria and was looking into transitioning. I do not know that I can do that alone. I do not know that I can do *anything* if I am spending 11 hours of my day, 5 days a week traveling and working. My supposed best friend honestly just fucking betrayed me; her leaving suddenly hurt, but jumping in bed with the last fucking person in the world I would ever be comfortable around, someone she knows well has hurt me. I had already been grappling with her dating other people because she said she wanted to start dating casually; I had wrapped my head around it, she said it would be a long time before she could even think about entering another actual relationship... and then, suddenly, she starts fucking an abusive, manipulative, horrible presence in my life, someone our friends have been working up to a confrontation with as they continue to sink their teeth in.I just do not know her anymore. she is a completely different person. I cannot understand what she sees in them, I cannot understand why she is doing any of this, it all came out of nowhere, and I cannot see my life getting any better from here. It feels like my life is over. It feels like I have nothing. Even our friend group is fracturing because of this fucking manipulative bastard sitting in the middle of it, laughing while they tear people down around them. I have no motivation. I am confused. I am lost. I am empty. I feel like I keep falling off of cliffs, one after another.I could move back east, live with my mom again. she is been asking me to do that the whole four years I have lived out west. She cries. She says she is depressed, has nothing without me, that she does not know what to do without me. But living with her was miserable. I could not do anything. I could not flourish. And then after 3 years of long distance I moved out west, giving up everything, and then I *did* flourish. For 4 years I grew and became something. I felt at home, at peace, I had a partner who I loved more than anything. We were a team, we were adventuring companions, we were each other's home.And now that is all gone. I do not know what to do. I do not know where to go from here. I feel empty and lost and shitty and I am stuck with the reality of this person who is been nothing but horrible to my friends and I running off with the woman I love, seemingly developing an entire false personality that is completely the opposite of how they behave whenever she is not around. they are the one fucking person in the world I could not handle her leaving me for. And fucking talking about them makes me feel insane, because ""developing an entire separate personality for the sake of manipulation"" sounds fucking crazy, it is something I would not believe at all if it is not something I was witnessing with my own eyes, and had not already seen my father do for years, and if I was the only one seeing it.

but it turns out, that the psychomotor agitation from hypomania can cause _the exact fucking same symptoms_. hashtag thanks-I-hate-it. I really prefer it when it just makes me fidget a lot or pace, ugh

which is incredibly confusing, but makes so much more sense in hindsight. aaaaaaaa

"Severe anxiety I’ll be honest I don’t exactly know the point of this post other than I’m really really tired of living and feeling the way I am. From ages 8-15 my life was terrible. My family was broken apart and pitted against each other, there was verbal and mental abuse every day, seeking help wasnt an option and it was all made to seem like normal life. 6 years later I’m still dealing with it. I know my anxiety and depression originated from my childhood and I know I have realistically nothing to worry about but no matter what I tell myself, what I prove to myself, how hard I work or how happy I try to be it’s never enough for me. I have a good job that I am interested in but it has turned into a nightmare. Even though I’m good at it literally as soon as I get off on my way home I will start having anxiety about potential fuck ups I can make and the work I have to do tomorrow. I’ll stress about work at least 50 more times before I clock back in the next day. I mean even when I sit in my car for lunch I start getting anxious. I see my friends maybe once a month due to a lack of motivation or interest in seeing anybody. It takes a long youtube video and about 30 minutes just to tell my brain to STFU and sleep. I dwell on my fuck ups and I’m scared shitless of letting people down. I say yes to basically anything anyone asks me to do (I actually think I’m scared of what people will say or do if I say no). The anxious feeling of what if stops me from meeting new people, going to fun places with my friends and enjoying life. Nothing gives me pleasure anymore and I rarely get excited about things. I feel very emotionally numb to everything EXCEPT stress, fear, worry, and anger. My anxiety and depression was a main factor in my first and last failed relationship due to me being so numb to myself and my SO. I feel like I care about nothing. I don’t find pleasure or happiness in being around my friends, doing the things I love or anything fun. My biggest problem and the main reason I’m making this post is that I don’t talk to ANYONE about it. I absolutely hate having to talk about how I feel and what I’m thinking, even if it’s not about anxiety.  All of my fear and worry starts and lives in my head and my head only. I actually get embarrassed having to talk about that shit. I’m just tired of feeling numb, I’m tired of not having fun, I’m tired of this emptiness and I’m tired of feeling and thinking so many things I don’t understand. But this has been my entire life. It’s not an on and off thing. It’s how I think and how I feel constantly and at this point it feels like normal life.

It’s almost like one part of me desires companionship and being more friendly because that’s what you need for a “happy life” (apparently) but putting myself out there never satisfies me. Having friends just stresses me out and makes me deeply insecure there’s literally no satisfaction I get from it. I guess I’m deeply unhealthy but I love to isolate and can’t relate to others and feel insecure about it, like I wish I could be in the standard of what’s normal but I’m also really addicted to unhealthy habits. Do I sound crazy 😭 it’s hard to put into words how I feel but it’s like I’m so closed off and avoidant around people and get stressed about societal pressures but am ok with my unhealthy isolation until I realize other people don’t live their lives like that.

"Do you feel that you fit in here? Or on Reddit in general? I've been mostly lurking around here for many months now, and I'm constantly seeing posts that make me feel like I don't belong, or I'm an odd one out. Like other people think and communicate in a certain way that's different from my own, or have an understanding of what AvPD means that clashes with my own, or they have (fairly ordinary) life experiences or achievements that seem impossible for me.

I don't know how much of it is due to the condition itself (if AvPD is even the right label for my specific brand of brokenness), and how much of it is due to objective differences related to the fairly unusual path I've taken through life.

Also, Reddit is regarded to have a kind of 'hive mind', where posters tend to express similar views in similar ways to the point where it's difficult to distinguish individuals. I see myself as an outsider looking at that from a distance, but do any of you see yourself as being a part of that?

If you don't feel you fit in, why is that, specifically? What details about you clash with what you perceive as the Reddit or r/AvPD culture(s)?

And if you DO feel you fit in, especially on Reddit in general, how does that relate to your AvPD? Is it easier to wear a metaphorical mask as a part of a collective, something like that?

I have tried everything to lose weight and nothing works. I have arthritis so working out is so hard, plus I am so shy that I am mortified of people looking at me while exercising.Everything is going wrong, I am so poor, and fat, and ugly that it just really feels like there is no point.

"Has CBD made anyone here /worse/? I’ve been smoking weed really heavily for a few months, and during my last manic episode it was giving me symptoms of psychosis like hearing voices and eventually started giving me 3 hour long panic attacks where I’m /convinced/ I’m dying. I finally decided to quit weed and threw all my weed out. I bought CBD oil at a hippy grocery store here and decided to try that since it’s literally proven to not make you intoxicated, calm anxiety, and there’s even studies showing it to be an antipsychotic. 

Last night I took it for the first time and I did feel great for the first hour or so. I was estatic that I finally found something that can help me sleep with out making me psychotic. Until I ended up having another panic attack. I became very anxious that every little ache I felt or inch I felt was a sign that I was going to drop dead from cancer anytime soon. I was shaking so hard and would stand up to do something but become so distracted that I’d just walk back and forth a few times and then lay back down in bed. I even heard voices like I usually do when I get really high on strong sativa. I honestly, definitely felt high, and CBD isn’t supposed to make you high at all! It’s just supposed to be like a muscle relaxer. 

I’m honestly so confused about why I had this reaction. I’m not manic anymore, I have definitely crashed into depression and have been depressed for a week or so now. The fact that I’m not manic and *supposedly* wasn’t high when this ‘panic attack’ happened is really concerning to me? Especially because I was still hearing voices? (I say *supposedly* because since there’s not any regulation laws on CBD, technically the manufacturer could leave traces of THC in it and not tell you, so I guess theoretically I could have been high. But I bought really expensive CBD from a really reputable store, so I’m hesitant to think that it would be spiked with THC)

I don’t have any of these symptoms during the day when I’m completely sober. I thought CBD was safe, everyone says it calms you down and relaxes you. Why tf did I have the opposite reaction? What are your experiences with CBD?",Bipolar

I don’t know if this is the right subreddit, but I am hoping someone knows what I’m talking about because I’m super frustrated and I tried to ask my doctor but they don’t know the answer either. 

Basically, my partner has been on lithium the day we met, and ever since meeting them, I’ve had frequent breakouts, patches of eczema emerging and rashes all over my body.  My period has also been coming late every month since meeting them and I have ALWAYS been regular and on time.

"My Checkup Was A Success (Long Post) **The background story:** Since I was diagnosed over 10 years ago, I've needed continuous/ongoing treatment and consultation. Changing dosages, trying new medication, talking through the most current triggers, how to recognize, avoid, cope, and foster healthy decisions. Gone through 4 doctors... when I was able to get an appointment and afford the treatment. I've gone some years withdrawing, some entirely unmedicated, new medication, lower dose/higher dose, self medicating at times. Having bipolar is truly debilitating and scary. Emotional (Mood) symptom wise, last year was not as intense as I've experienced before. But last year was indeed the shittiest fucking year I have lived through in my entire life thus far. I won't list everything that was shitty. You guys know last year was horrible. My Mom almost dying before her liver transplant probably topped my list though. And my bipolar mania has decided to manifest entirely through my secondary symptoms of OCD. Chronic anxiety has taken over my usual depression and has crash landed directly on one main symptom. [Self Excoriation/dermatillomania/compulsive skin picking.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excoriation_disorder) No exaggeration, I look like the picture in that Wikipedia link, just add breasts and some curves. I'm not looking for advice or guidance. I've been receiving the professional version steadily over a year and a half now. I just know that CSP is not common in this sub, is often not associated with bipolar, and is still considered co morbid along with symptoms of OCD.

**The point of my post.:** I saw my psychiatrist today. And he agreed that I have had very significant improvements since I last saw him. My episodes have been less frequent, less intense, and my depression has also eased up. My mania still keeps me awake throughout the week (I get 3-4 hrs sleep at a time around 4-7am.) and I literally sleep all weekend. But my job hasn't been suffering, I've made three trips from the west coast to Texas for some extremely intense circumstances, I've lost 30lbs, and reduced my ""skin picking"" from my legs and lower arms to just my upper arms, back, and face although my face has had dramatic improvements as well. 

**My checkup Achievement:** For the first time since I can remember, my doctor isn't changing my medication and has said that I don't need to schedule a follow up appointment at this time. I will continue to have a steady supply of my personal med cocktail without worrying about running out. I'm under no obligation to pay for, schedule, drive to, or stress about coordinating  my life around another psych appointment until I feel it's necessary.

"I'm really struggling I've suffered with Anxiety for about 5/6 years now, however in the last year my health anxiety has gotten extremely bad. 
Everywhere hurts at different times or different days and I constantly think I'm going to die. Whether it be a pain in my chest, or a rash on my arm or even if I find a bump one somewhere.

About a year and a half ago I started saying  'touch wood' if I or anyone else said something worrying that might happen. Eg if I said 'I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack' followed by me saying 'touch wood' and then touching something wooden. It made me feel secure, like it made it not true and it wouldn't happen once I said and touched it.

However it then got extremely out of control to the point where any time I even thought about something happening to me I'd tap the side of my head twice (for some reason this was my new 'touch wood instead of trying to find something actually wooden) 
I still say it sometimes, but if I only think of something terrible happening I won't say anything out loud but rather say it in my head and touch my temple twice. I know this sounds crazy weird but I literally can't go a day without doing it now. 

My health anxiety is so bad. I've been reading other posts and I relate to most of them which really stresses me out. I will always go to the worse case scenario and I can't stop. I'm constantly getting pains in my arm or numbness, shortness of breath, chest pains, headaches, shaking etc. I know/hope deep down its my anxiety but I can never calm myself down.

To make it worse my boyfriend gets annoyed at me for 'constantly being sick' ie when I have headaches or even when I get a numb pain or something he usually tells me I'm over reacting which makes me more stressed and upset. 

Idk if this is even the right place to post and even posting it is making me super anxious. I just can't get a moment to relax. My whole life is revolving around my anxiety. Every single day I think of death and how this might be my last day etc.

How do I stop this? I'm really losing my mind.

"Diagnosed, but having doubts I'd like to preface first by saying that I'm not American.

I've been diagnosed bipolar II a few year ago during while in a psych ward. During all the years I've been seeing psychiatrists, it was brought up only once by a psychiatrist I've seen for less than a month. I've been somewhat successfully treated with seroquel. 

While I thought I had BP before my diagnosis,  this diagnosis as almost always made very little sense to me. I do have some pretty extreme mood swings, but far more than 4-5  a year and they sometimes last only hours.

The psychiatrist who followed me years never brought it up. He didn't change my meds, didn't really take any interest in my symptoms. He was pretty much happy just continuing the traitement that was prescribed to me during my trip to the psych ward. Last therapist didn't seem to believe I had any illness.

I'm seeing any therapists or psychiatrists anymore and I have stopped my meds. So far, I'm doing alright.

"Tips on how to accept my symptoms are just anxiety and start living again?? The last month has been such a struggle for me. I started having panic attacks where my heart rate would spike to 150-180. I went to my doctor in case it wasn’t anxiety and just had my Holter Monitor results come back. I had one of these attacks while on it and thankfully no dangerous rhythms were found. Just some high rates but not sustained so my doctor is unconcerned. So once again, this is all anxiety. 

My therapist thinks it’s because I started a new job last month and I’m falling back into my old health anxiety habits because “Stress compounds symptoms”. 

This has gotten so bad that the past week I haven’t even been able to leave my bed out of fear of my heart getting too high. Due to probably the fear when I cooked or did dishes my heart rate could get up to 130 then if I noticed and began to worry it went up to 160.

Now that I know I’m fine I thought I’d be okay but I’m still constantly watching my smart watch to see how high my heart rate gets then panicking when I see it go above 120 from just walking around the house but when I’m calm it doesn’t go over like 110. This happened on the Holter and it was normal. I know this is just anxiety but I can’t stop obsessing that I have a heart issue that’ll kill me. 

I just need help to take the smart watch off and stop taking my blood pressure. It’s just making everything worse. Yesterday alone, according to my logs, I took my blood pressure 50 times. I was worried because my bp was low when standing yet my heart rate was high so I thought it was dangerous. It happened again this morning and my heart rate got to 165.

"I was a depressive alcoholic for the last couple of years, though I was still able to function and work and be responsible enough to get by, when I told my family I was a drunk(East Indian background and traditional) they hoped me well and said they love me but they did not want to associate with me until I got my depression and alcoholism and life in general order because they are embarrassed what my relatives would think if they found out about my issues.They stopped talking to me, my siblings stopped talking to me as well when they found out I was an alcoholic. I never really had many friends in life I can rely on either. I reached out to a few acquaintances but ultimately after a few kind words they stopped talking to me. 2 years later, after extensive therapy and AA work I am better and have a better job, I am more fit and generally happier. I have also had an easier time making friends and getting dates through online apps. However I noticed I still do not trust any of these people, because I always remember deep down when I needed help the most and someone to just talk to, the only help I got was myself, so I am jaded because I do not trust people to be there for me anymore, not when I really need them. I just wanted advice, how do I overcome this cynicism, even therapy has not been helping with it. 27 M that got his depression under wrap after many years but still slightly traumatized and distrustful because the only person that got me through it was me.",Depression

"I won't go into too much detail but what stems off of that is thoughts of being and feeling worthless like I'm not good enough for anyone and that I'm undeserving of the good things given to me but then another thought stems off of that one which would be something along the lines of me thinking how stupid I was acting and then another thought after that and so on. Another little thing I'd like to add is that that I seriously struggle seeing my own self worth and how much I mean to my friends and family (who are all amazing by the way I love them all so much). Eventually on fairly rare occasions those thoughts tend to lead to depression, paranoia that people around me hate me and don't want anything to do with me, dissociation with reality and then finally the rock bottom of that would be thoughts of suicide (though I've never acted out on these thoughts or would ever want to) and the occasional anxiety attack where I feel nauseous, my heart beats really fast, my limbs feel like jelly, heavy breathing, I feel panicked and I just want to get out of the situation as quickly as possible. Other than that though I'm quite optimistic and I tend to be a genuinely upbeat and happy person!

"Can't stop worrying For the past few weeks I've been having flashing in my vision. It's usually a very small white light that appears for a split second then goes away once I try to look at it. Well ever since that started happening I've like been sent over the edge and am almost constantly worrying that I have a myriad of neurological diseases, from a stroke to retinal detachment to a brain tumor. I've also been having stomach pains like nausea for the past few days but I'm not sure if im making up phantom nausea because I'm worried I have a brain tumor. I also have had some on and off mild headaches but like I said above I could just be imagining it into existence. I went in yesterday for a full eye exam and the optomologist said my eyes, retina and all are in perfect condition. Because of this I am now more than ever convinced I have a brain tumor and am about to die. Sorry for the rant I just needed somewhere to vent.

"how are some people able to not care so much? if they miss work, if they’re late to an event, if someone or other is upset with them, some people don’t let that shit get them down. but for me it turns into a self-hating spiral of why I can’t function.

do you relate to holding onto and beating yourself up for small personal failures?

while I’m here, I have one other question. I notice my emotions and my reaction to my emotions is extremely dependent on my immediate environment. that is to say, I don’t take discomfort well at all. I don’t cope with thoughts like “it will be over soon” “next time won’t be so bad” because I can’t get myself out of the suffering of the here and now. for my life, this makes working hard, which makes money hard, which lends itself to the spiral of worthlessness.

I abuse dissociative drugs for this reason, it’s the only possible way to escape the reality of the present, which is often uncomfortable. the dxm actually not only pulls me away but allows me to see things objectively, and see the beauty and humor in life, how small I am and how big everything else is, things like that.

I don’t mean to derail, I know it’s not a drug sub. but so, do you find your emotions to be a direct reaction of the environment around you, so much so that you can’t avoid them, and spend much of your life actively suffering like me?

"I have been suicidal since I was 17. I was miserable. Always drinking, self harming, never being honest with my family or friends and always unhappy. They all found out eventually because I had to stay at a psych ward for 2 weeks in 2017. Fast forward to present day, I meet the most incredible human being ever. We worked together, and became friends. He understood me, asked questions about my feelings, stayed on the phone with me for hours late at night, until 5 or 6am some nights. When I was talking or hanging out with him, I had no worries and I was the happiest I have been since going to Disneyland when I was a kid.Only problem is, I started to fall in love. He is taken, so I kept it to myself. I tried to get over it and just be friends. Sometimes it would be worth it and other times it would hurt but I stuck through the pain because he is too important to lose. I do not talk to my family or any other friends like that. I have tried. Hes the only one I got besides my therapist. It got to be too much one night and I ended up confessing my feelings. He said we could still be friends. That was a week ago, and he will not reply to any of my texts or calls. I am torn between giving him space and trying to fix this but it seems like he just needs time. I have been doing everything I can to distract myself. I feel empty. I cannot do this without him. A part of me is missing. I have barely spoke since this happened. I drink all the time, smoking non stop. Anything to make me forget that I might have just fucked up the best thing for me. I cannot stop thinking about all the memories we were going to share. I feel destroyed. I miss him so much. do not tell me Ill find another friend one day because this friendship is different, its once in a lifetime. my best friend is not talking to me and I just want to rot away.",Suicidal
"Being treated like a drug addict I have been on antidepressants since the age 15. I have severe anxiety that sometimes leads to anxiety attacks. In the past few months…. 1) I hit a deer equaling $4000 worth of damage with a $2000 deductible; 2) I used all my sick days at work; 3) my psychiatrist quit and I wasn’t able to get my Zoloft or adhd meds filled; 4) an electrical panel in my car stopped working; 5) I paid almost $200 for a rental car while mine was in the shop and I couldn’t even use it the first day because it wouldn’t make it up my icy driveway, causing me to be late for work. 

It was that day I decided to go to my usual walk in clinic to see if they could call me in Zoloft because I was having a hard time getting out of bed. See, your body can’t stay in fight or flight mode indefinitely (which is what anxiety is) so eventually it has to shut down (depression). I get there and they tell me I have to have an appointment. That was apparently the straw that broke the camel’s back. I began crying and hyperventilating. It was one of my worst panic attacks ever. Part of me was concerned they were going to have me committed. They were able to call in a 30 day supply and made me a follow up appointment. Which was today.

And they remembered my scene. So obviously my erratic behavior is because I’m a drug addict. I never once had to take a drug test to get my adhd meds with my old psych. This time they asked me to pee in a cup. I have anxiety so of course my first thought was that they thought I was bonkers the other day, but I had nothing to hide so I obliged. When I got home I got a call saying they couldn’t call in my meds because I tested positive for opiates. Excuse me? That’s IMPOSSIBLE. They said I would need to bring in a prescription to explain the reason I failed. I said I hadn’t taken anything, and that I could now care less about my medicine but this needed fixed to clear my name. They said they could send it off to the lab, and I said YES YOU BETTER DO THAT! Yes, I am still being emotional and irrational at this point. Not because of what they are accusing me but because my seratonin and dopamine receptors DO NOT WORK like they should…which is the reason I was going there for help. Instead, they decide to bring a devastating accusation against a person with emotional dysregulation (ADHD) and anxiety (generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder). It is negligence. What if this behavior caused a person to harm themselves? Do no harm. The way in which they handled this was very harmful. Almost as if they have no training on how to handle delicate individual (which medical personnel should). 

I did some research and guess what….poppy seeds! I just made a batch of lemon poppy muffins the day before yesterday. Surely the lab will be able to differentiate between poppy seeds and an actual drug, right??? It’s a small town and I KNOW they will break patient confidentiality because I’m a teacher…I just know it…I’ve had soMe of their kids in class. Of course they will tell other parents. 

I’m done with my ADHD meds…I refuse to jump through these hoops anymore. And to be treated like a criminal. I’m erratic yes, but not because of drugs. I’m falling apart right now.",Anxiety

"He cries every day. The first thing he always talks about when he wakes up is how much he wants to die and wishes he did not wake up, everyday without fail. For months he is said everyday has made him want to die more than the last. Hes begged me to kill him, so hand him poinson while bawling so hard on the floor he cannot get up to get it himself. He said ""you would be mercy killing me"". He cannot go to a mental hospital for various reasons, we are both minors (I am emancipated hes not) living alone together, and he has quite a long time before he becomes an adult with controlling over his own life. His mom neglects him and refuses to give him the medical help he needs despite his therapist telling her how at risk he is for suicide, she will not allow him to transition (we are both transgender) and he feels like nothing could ever make him see the light through the dark. Not even me. Not even smoking weed helps him anymore because he does not even get stoned anymore and that is the only thing that slows his thoughts and eases his ptsd. On top of that were financially struggling and we cannot afford to keep buying weed but if I do not keep buying I risk coming home to find my boyfriend dead. I would reach out to authorities and ask him to be helped but we live in a rural bible belt community that would surely make things worse rather than better for him. He recently told me ""next time you go back to work, I am going to do it. I can give anymore. Its too painful. All of our friend manipulate us and we cannot trust them."" It took me days of spending every second bwside him to assure him I would not be ask okay as he thinks I would be if he was not here. He told me ""its going to be okay when I am gone. do not be sad, please move on and be happy."" He feels so alone like he only has me. And it took the risk of getting fired and losing the house to make him promise me I would not come home to a corpse. I told him I could not go back to work until I knew. I know he still wants to die more and more every day, and he cries more and more every day about the pain of being alive and reliving his trauma and worrying about everything and feeling so out of place and uncomfortable amd burdening in any situation hes placed in. I do not care how worn out and exaughsted I am only sleeping one hour a night making sure he does not kill himself, I love him and I need him. But I know its selfish to keep him here under so much suffering. I feel its comparable to watching somome go through chemo without hope of even going into remission, knowing they are going to die in pain and just wanting for that day to come. ""But I need you in my life"". ""But I need my life to be over to feel any sense of peace."" He tells me it follows him into his sleep. He cannot escape the PTSD and the trauma and the thoughts and his therapist treats him like a kid so they do not do sessions anymore because all she talks about is school, which is another reason he wants to die. He does not see any positives to living and it is rare for me to come up with ideas that actually make him feel better. He never feels better for more than a few minutes at a time. Hes been through depressive episodes before but none that have been this harsh and long, ever. I have never seen or heard of anyone who seems to be living in such a constant state of agony. He craves the pain of death because to him it is an answer to his prayers of escape. I do not know what to do anymore. I feel like it is only a matter of time before I loose him and he keeps telling me that too. there is no adults who can help him now, atleast not in the situation hes in. I just need to know what to say or do. I need to know that I am doing the right thing by keeping him alive, even though I can tell it tourchers him to be conflicted about hurting me and hurting more each day. Am I doing the wrong thing? Sometimes it feels like I am. Please help. I do not know how to help my boyfriend. What should I do?",Suicidal

"Help with your HIV, STD anxiety I recently got a full STD test done which included blood work for HIV and Syphilis, and let me tell you I haven’t felt anxiety like this in a good while. I was constantly checking my online health portal and refreshing my email to see if my results came in. The whole week was nothing but dread. Because of my depression and anxiety I have engaged in some risky and self destructive behavior in the past.  Last night night results came in clean and negative thankfully! I just wanted to share an article with you that really helped me and puts things in to perspective. I really hope this helps and makes things better for those of you in a similar situation. Be safe and get tested and you will be fine I promise! Life goes on and is too short to be spent worrying. Enjoy!

"I get anxious because I am worried about bad things that I think may happen in my life. Im worried about losing my job, my girlfriend might leave me for someone more funny, with a better job, that is more self confident etc. You think these things because you perceive yourself to have no value. I get so preoccupied with these worries and it constantly undermines my self esteem that it applies to other areas in your life, even everyday interactions, going to the store, these can be extremely stressful events. You're so unconfident in yourself that you have a million thoughts a second and constantly second guess yourself.",Stress

"Does anyone else diagnosed with BiPolar feel that your doctor essentially treats you like having emotions is a “privilege” you are no longer fit for? They always give meds that basically zombify you. Joy=mania, sadness=depression. They act like you’re just not allowed to feel anything anymore because you’re a danger to yourself. It really makes me feel that there’s no way out of this constant cycle and I really just don’t want to do it anymore. Euthanasia would be so much more favorable of an option to me at this point but if you talk like that you just get sent away to be around people that make you feel even worse about yourself.

I've been on some medicine these past few weeks (I can't remember the name) and I think they may actually be working. I still get depressed and/or anxious around the night time or when I'm not doing something. I just have to keep myself busy and I'll be okay.

But about the party. I knew almost everyone there, I've known them for a long time now and they're closer to me than my family. I helped set up the party so I didn't feel like I wasn't being useful, I took my time this morning in making sure I looked presentable, and of course I showed up early just in case. 

The party lasted about an hour and a half, and I even got to talk with some of the people there! 


Today is just a great day so far, and (not if but) when things start to go back down to normal, I hope I don't forget that I was able to be happy today.

Now I’m stressing I had my first Calculus test today and due to feeling nervous, I accidentally copied a problem wrong which changed my answer completely. I did the steps right and I know for a fact that I could’ve gotten the right answer if I hadn’t misread the problem. That one problem was 15 points total and I’m scared I’ll lose 15 points just because the answer is different. I studied for 4 days straight prior to the test so I felt confident with my knowledge.

"Faking Sorry if I rant but I don't know why people never seem to take me seriously. I've been accused before of exaggerating. And my moods being a ""self-fulfilling prophecy"". Early on, I was diagnosed multiple times with depression and anxiety. Because 75% of my mania is comprised of mixed/dysphoria. I get very moody. The only question anyone ever asked was ""do you spend a lot of money"", and when I was younger I didn't have the money to spend 20,000$ even if I wanted to. Anything else -anger, excessive energy, no sleep, etc- was labelled anxiety or agitated depression. Whenever I disagreed -and rightly so- ""professionals"" thought I was just vying for a bipolar diagnosis. Despite my reactions to the antidepressants they always insisted on. The only way I got properly treated was after a case of road rage.

Years later, I struggle with the fear of being accused of faking. I can see it in their faces. And at times I'm afraid that I'm actually faking. It's been really taking a toll on me lately. 2018 was a year of relapse for me and again with an empty bank account I'm faced with having to ""prove it"". Right now I feel like I should stop taking all of my meds and embrace whatever my brain gives me, maybe I'll be blessed with some euphoric mania. I feel sick. I hate myself. Screw all of them.
